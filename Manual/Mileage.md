# Mileage

> Mileage is not a way for you to pad your salary. 

*Mileage is a way for us to make sure you are adequately compensated for wear and tear on your vehicle where an alternative transportation method cannot be provided for you.*

Frogs are eligible to claim mileage expenses only when they have been required by Treefrog to travel more than 35 km from the office for business purposes. *This is an industry standard rule and prevents us from dying from a thousand administrative papercuts.*

Mileage will not be granted for travel to and from work. Obviously. Move closer to your work, already.

The following guidelines are to be followed to claim mileage and other company related expenses:

1. You must request access to a vehicle first. We will try to have one for you to borrow that matches our brand and philosophies.
2. Mileage must be calculated from the work site as the starting point.

If travelling **less than 85 km round trip**, please try to use the electric car (for obvious environmental reasons), and if it’s not available, then request a rental car to be booked through  Client Care.  If you chose to use your own vehicle, Treefrog will pay a maximum of the cost of a rental car (roughly $45, subject to change), or $.52/km, whichever is **lower**.

If travelling more than 85 km round trip, please try to use the electric car, and if it’s not available, then request a rental car to be booked ([Client Care] (aka reception), handles this).  If you chose to use your own vehicle, Treefrog will pay a maximum of $45, since that would be the cost of a rental.

Frogs may use their personal vehicle for business purposes if it is less expensive than renting a car, taking a taxi, or using alternate transportation, and **your car represents Treefrog's brand accordingly**. Otherwise, you are taking advantage of Treefrog for your own gain or representing our team incorrectly. *Use your common sense judgement when interpreting this: as in, the amount you are billing for mileage shouldn't exceed what you are paying for your car.*

If you are using your own vehicle for business purposes, Treefrog will pay up to a maximum of $100/week for all travel expenses. Because if this is a regular thing, we should be coming up with an alternative travel mechanism for you - like leasing another car. Treefrog  should not be paying your car lease.

If you are regularly driving to a specific client far away, the cost of your mileage should be an additional charge to the client. It is your responsibility to ensure this happens, as others may not be aware of this happening.

If you are planning a trip to a client's location and then plan to carry on from there to a place for your own pleasure, you shouldn't be claiming mileage. You are abusing the system. We are all in this together.

If you claim mileage and **didn't actually drive to where you said you did**, you are no longer eligible for mileage claims. **You must have actually gone to where you said you went** - you can't just make up addresses for the sake of roughing out a claim. It's called "fraud", and your position at Treefrog should be reviewed for this.

*Please note that Treefrog requires 48 hours’ notice to have a rental car delivered. Failure to plan in advance does not constitue a reason to cause Treefrog additional expense.
