# Bereavement Leave

> If your family member dies, you should take a break and mourn.

In the event of a death of an immediate family member, Frogs are entitled to a bereavement leave with the CEO’s approval. Frogs who wish to take a bereavement leave shall provide notice to their pod leader as soon as practicable after learning of a death that qualifies for this type of leave.    All full-time Frogs with one (1) or more years of continuous service will be granted up to three (3) days of bereavement leave with pay.   

Immediate family includes:

* A spouse*

* The spouse of the employee's child
* A brother or sister of the employee
* A relative of the employee who is dependent on the employee for care or assistance

**Note: “spouse” includes both married and common-law couples of the same sex or the opposite sex.*
 
Additional paid or unpaid bereavement leave may be granted at the discretion of the CEO. These requests should be discussed in person with the CEO and followed by a written submission.
