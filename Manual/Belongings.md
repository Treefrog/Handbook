# Belongings

> Keep your stuff at home and Treefrog's stuff at Treefrog.

*Best to not mix personal items with Treefrog items if at all possible. Best not to take home **anything** belonging to Treefrog for personal use without explicit permission*

*This obviously does not apply to laptops.

Frogs are discouraged from bringing personal items to the workplace. If necessary, only the minimal amount of personal belongings should be kept at the workplace, and it is the Frogâ€™s responsibility to keep his or her belongings in a secure location. Treefrog will not accept responsibility for lost, stolen, or damaged personal articles. This includes the use of your own personal devices at work.

If you need something at work required to do your job, **Treefrog should be buying it for you**. You should not have to buy the item yourself. If there is something *absolutley required* to do your job, ask Treefrog to provide it.

This does not apply to specialty items, especially food.

If there is an item that you own that is at Treefrog under extenuating circumstances, **make sure it is marked clearly with your name on it**, like your mother used to do with your underwear. Then we know it is yours.

One place where this breaks down is in items you use for commuting or dual-purposes (e.g. headphones). Best case scenario, get two pairs. Use one pair for when you are at work that Treefrog will provide because you need noise reduction while working. Once you get to work, lock up your personal pair and then take them home when you leave.

### Rationale

There are a number of reasons why we, as a team, do not want your personal belongings at work:

1. Personal items are not insured on the premises unless explicitly listed in our insurance list and originally paid for by Treefrog. Personal items could be stolen, or "borrowed", or damaged by others and are considered to be outside of our bubble of liability. 
2. If you suddenly get sick or called away and we have to move your belongings while you are gone, we do not know what is yours and what belongs to the company.

### Examples

1. We have had several examples of people "borrowing", from each other's desks, items that go missing for weeks (e.g. charging cables).
2. We regularly have external events, kids, friends, etc. roaming around the place. We do not want to worry about your special Luck Troll.
3. A company we used to work with made their employees bring in their own toilet paper to keep costs down. This is a broken idea.
