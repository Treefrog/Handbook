# Compensation

> Payment of Frogs should not get in the way of life or productivity.

<i> Treefrog intentianlly takes on additional administration and hassle in compensating its Frogs to assist Frogs and their familes.</i>

### Pay Schedule: Weekly

Treefrog pays salaried employees on a weekly basis on the week subsequent to the week worked. Payment is by Direct Deposit on Friday. In order to best benefit Frogs, we endeavour to pay earlier than this to minimize banking turnaround limitations.

Despite the difficulties this presents to cash flow and associated banking costs, it has been our experience that this greatly helps Frogs (especially at the beginning of their careers) to live without "bumps".

#### By Cheque

If by chance a Frog cannot recieve pay by Direct Deposit, the Frog may be paid by cheque. Cheques are distributed on Fridays.  It is the employee’s responsibility to collect his or her cheque on the allocated day of distribution.  In the event of a statutory holiday falling on the normal cheque distribution day, cheques will be distributed on the day prior to the statutory holiday.

### Employment Status

Full-time is defined as working a regular 40 hour work week or more. Part-time is 24 hours or less per week. Temporary Frogs are employed to fill a temporary vacancy or carry out a specific function for a period of time.
