# To Quit or Not to Quit

> If you leave Treefrog high and dry, you suck.

Treefrog doesn't fire people, if at all possible.

*Anyone at Treefrog has the right to leave at any time (**voluntary leaving**), and we have the right to ask people to leave at any time (**involuntary leaving**) - but the Treefrog philosophy is that Treefrog goes **far above and beyond to try and make things work with members of our team** if they are not performing well or are unhappy. In return we humbly request that people don’t suddenly quit and leave us high and dry - but rather they work with the rest of us to figure out how to be happy or in a worse case scenario, transition out amicably while both you and the company remain intact.*

Loyalty goes both ways, we should protect one another past the point of comfort.

In other word, Treefrog doesn't fire people unless there is absolutely no way we can make it work (**dysfunctional leaving**), a very rare occurence, although if we can’t figure out a mutually satisfying direction, we can mutually agree that its best that we go different ways (**functional leaving**). Most people “quit" because they are “in the dip” and can’t see a way out - and usually, once a few conversations are had, we can find a new place for them at Treefrog (or their skills just get naturally strengthened over time) and they are now astonishingly happy here and valuable members of our team a few months later. “Quitting” doesn’t help anyone, any more than “firing people when things look a little bad” does.

There is an expectation that we'll have each other's back.

Plus, at Treefrog we treat each other much more like family than other companies, so people leaving is harder than usual on the rest of us who stay and stick it out. We genuinely experience group grief when people leave - like someone is cutting off an appendage.

### Standard Process

Unfortunately, every situation for someone leaving is completely different. Although it has been suggested that we should have a “standard process” for people who leave - pretty much everyone who leaves leaves on different terms and for different reasons.

## Quitting vs. Transitioning

*There are remarkably different ways to leave.*

### Quitting

If you disappear with very little notice (aka "**quit**"), you don’t give Treefrog a chance...

- to re-strategize around your disappearing,
- to find a replacement in time without hurting others or clients (or adjust the pod structure or sales goals accordingly),
- and to help you to ensure we can’t do something better or different to support you.

If you quit without notice, you are hurting the people you leave behind. You hurt the clients we were working on, you hurt our relationships and you lower everyone else’s salary. All of these results are counter-intuitive to Treefrog core philosophies - by quitting, you are breaking with the mutual agreement of "more mutual loyalty than at other companies".

#### How do I know I’m quitting?

- You give minimum notice (2 weeks or less).
- You leave mid-way during active projects.
- You sign a contract before you talk it out with your Champion and give us a chance to work with you.

### Transitioning

An alternate strategy is to “**transition out**” of the company.

If you feel like you are unhappy at Treefrog, or you think you have greater opportunities elsewhere, let’s work on making you happier or transition you out.

In this case, you know you have a better opportunity somewhere else, or you are just unhappy, so you have the intent of leaving. You then openly talk to a Pod Leader clearly and directly that you are unhappy and actively looking for work elsewhere. While actively looking for work, you also actively try and work with your team/Pod to improve your life and stay open-minded about how things might possibly improve.

#### How do I know I’m transitioning?

- You haven't signed a contract yet (though you may have even started looking).
- Your plans are open-minded to help Treefrog and yourself transition.
- Before you sign an alternate contract, you have a discussion with others on the team (Your Champion, or the CEO), and give yourself a meaningful opportunity to find happiness and success at Treefrog.

**Treefrog will never walk a person to the door or fire them for saying you want to leave.** It's a natural thing that will definitely happen to you at some point at Treefrog. Don't hide it! (Having said that, don't constantly have the attitude, either).

Have an open discussion, and be brave, and we'll find a way to ensure that we all remain intact.

NOTE that is it possible that you attempt to transition, but overwhelming odds prevent you from fulfilling your transition period (read: your performance slows past the point of effectiveness during the transition), in which case there will be a mutual ongoing dialogue about your leaving earlier. In which case, you’ve attempted to transition, but it fails. That’s better than quitting!

### "Pretend Lay Offs"

In many cases, we get requests to "pretend lay off" as opposed to "accept quitting", so that the person in question can "scoop" some EI. **We don't do this, it is fraud.** In addition, there are several nagative implications to our company;

1. It's fraud. That alone makes it something we wouldn't do.
2. We have to replace you. All possible grants/benefits that the government might have given us to help the transition hole you left are now impossible to get.
3. If we are trying to do something (like get people into the coutry), this negatively affects the perception of Treefrog to government arms.

YES, we lay people off due to lack of work, in absolute and complete desperate circumstances. It's an unfortunate part of life, but it means the company survives to possibly hire you back in the future.

NO, if you quit or transition, we will not pretend you didn't.

#### Examples of Transitioning

1) **Transition** - X indicated her intent to leave, talked with the CEO about other possibilities and stuck around for a few months trying to make sure she was making the right decision, and then gave significant (months) notice, and then helped us find a fantastic replacement candidate after weeks of personal effort setting the new person up for success and helping her team manage the transition (which they have done so magnificently).

2) **Transition** - X also gave many months of notice, and indicated he wouldn’t leave until the Frogs were all looked after - has survived several false starts of team members to replace himself in various capacities, and is actively working with agility to make sure nothing happens to us on his way out.

*We were able to have open discussions with both individuals, time to analyze and discuss in front of all Frogs publicly (at State of the Union, in both cases), and more. This is a respectful and dignified way to leave without hurting anyone, and earns them the right to come back to Treefrog in the future - in my mind, they are still “Frogs for Life”.

#### Examples of Quitting

3) **Quit** - Z sent an email indicating they were giving 2 weeks notice, then called in sick for 3 days. Then, called in and asked "if she really needed to come in again" (answer: yes, we are still paying you, that's what "2 weeks notice" is)

4) **Quit** - X left with effectively zero notice (asked to be walked to the door, even though this would have been a disaster for many of our clients), talked to clients before they left about their leaving (damaging tens of thousands of dollars of work for us, albeit innocently), talked to Frogs about it (sowing seeds of discontent and doubt for others, and creating emotional chaos and lowering productivity for everyone - going on walks and meeting for hours about the decision), left on a week when their team was mostly on holiday (thus ruining their team member’s holidays) etc., etc. It had a direct cost to us of thousands of dollars, indirect costs of tens of thousands of dollars, and cost everyone here at the company anguish (some more than others) and ultimately, salary (we eat what we kill).



### “Last to Know”

Most people have a sense that they are “the last to know”, and feel like they have been slighted because there isn’t a giant fanfare about people leaving (as if we always know months ahead that people are leaving, which we do not) - giving them the ability to hug it out and mourn their family loss accordingly. But the rule of thumb is this: if people have announced they are quitting, this leaves a dark cloud following said person around the last few weeks they are around, lowers everyone’s productivity, and makes everyone miserable. It adds complexity and rumours and self-doubt. It costs everyone major hassle and slows their future success.

Additionally, every time someone walks around the office and hugs everyone on their way out, it causes completely unnecessary emotional chaos, puts everyone is shock and makes everyone feel like suddenly Treefrog is a horrible place to be (which, for record, it is not). The person always has to have an “excuse”, which is unnecessary and often contrived.

People leave. It sucks. We hate it. But we are not going to mourn or celebrate it. We will keep going.

The rule of thumb:

- If someone is transitioning, we’ll announce it publicly well ahead of time, and give people lots of chance to talk it out and come to terms with it. There is a fair assumption that this isn’t a dysfunctional disappearance, and it’s just a life change. Though unfortunate, it is respectful and dignified.

- If someone is quitting, it shouldn’t be (will not be) shared until after the person has left, on a strictly “need to know” basis. It doesn’t do anything but damage to those who remain.

In many cases, even after a discussion about someone leaving is far down the pike, the person changes their mind once things start to get a little better. I’ve even refused people handing me termination letters, because I can see things they don’t. In these cases, we won’t tell people until last minute (or until an absolute and final decision has been made), because undoing it is so hard on the team.

Again, these are just rules of thumb, as every situation is completely different. We just want to maximize the success of the people who continue, because the people leave no longer drive our success. (Yes, past employees are still great friends of ours - but especially if they quit, how does that benefit Treefrog? I’ve yet to see, in 20 years, a meaningful positive effect of a past employee).

### “We Own the Client Relationship”

There is also the additional feeling that anyone who leaves wants to talk it out with each client. Simply put: no. Every time this happens, we get into massive expensive discussions with the client and in every case, it sends the client for a spin.

Treefrog owns the relationship. The person who picks up behind the quitter needs to manage the transition, not the quitter.

If you quit, no discussion will happen with clients about your leaving until you are gone. If you transition, we will likely inform clients after we have found and enacted a suitable replacement to keep the clients successful and intact.

### “Turning off the Door Code"

We have had the experience that someone, after they gave their notice of 2 weeks, came into Treefrog after the fact and decided to “help themselves” to a variety of things (like paper, sharpies, boxes of paper clips, and the like) with the intent of starting up their own business. “But this is just office stuff”, they said. *smacks head*.

If you quit (vs transition), your door code will be turned off immediately. This is not a point of disrespect, but of protection of those who are left to pick up behind you. If you’ve been here less than a year, your door code will likely be turned off as well. You are not to be on the premises outside of business hours. (This is as much for your own safety as Treefrog’s).

If you transition, there is an underlying trust to the relationship, so this doesn’t really apply. You keep your door code, no problem, until your last day.

Basically, when you quit, we will be shutting down all communication mechanisms and anything you don’t absolutely require to minimize every else’s brain drain. The focus will be on keeping the rest of the team alive after you leave, not on you.

### The Goodbye Party

In many cases, people would like to remain friends with people who leave, which is normal and appropriate, despite the professional severance. This is usually why people want to know why someone is leaving (unless it affects their job, in which case they will have a “need to know” anyway). However, in this case.

Ergo, effective immediately, we will be instituting a new policy at Treefrog: the goodbye dinner. It works like this;

1) People who leave will be asked if they want a goodbye party. They may or may not want this.
2) This will be booked for approximately ONE WEEK after their last paid day, on an evening, organized by them.
3) Frogs will be let known of this date, anyone who can make it, can come out.
3) Treefrog takes no responsibility for the costs or anything whatsoever of the party.

### The 6-Month Mourning Period

If you left on bad terms, please don't come back. It's just weird.

Coming back into the office within a few days of leaving is tacky, and makes everyone uncomfortable. After you have left - don't come back to the office again. If you need to get stuff you have forgotten, arrange to come in with a senior Frog to collect your stuff at the end of the day, so you don't cause a bunch of emotion

If you transitioned, after 6 months, it's fine to come back and visit. We'd love to see you!

If you quit, give it a decade or two.
