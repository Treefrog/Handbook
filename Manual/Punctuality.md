# Punctuality/Tardiness

> Don't be late. It's disrespectful to others.

<i>Punctuality reflects a positive interest and attitude towards others on the team, and likewise reflects on your likelihood of success at Treefrog. Habitually arriving late for work is not acceptable. If you say you are going to be in at a certain time, make a point of doing so.</i>

If you are going to be late for work, you must notify your Pod Leader and team (via Slack or alternative means) as soon as possible or by no later than 9:00 a.m. if your flexible time starts earlier. The rest of the team needs to function effectively, despite your being later than expected.
