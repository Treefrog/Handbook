> Raging against Mediocrity

<i> What does it take to be a performance-oriented excellent employee at Treefrog?</i>

By taking the initiative to become a high-performance Frog, you help us all achieve greatness, not just yourself. Take a look at the following components and self-assess regularly. By choosing one area to consciously work on at a time, you will help the team dramatically and in turn grow yourself.

The table below is largely stolen verbatim from an HR book by Bradford D. Smart, PhD entitled “TopGrading” (*the hours and IQ are from him, not Treefrog - consider this accordingly). What follows is industry standard knowledge compiled from the book in the format provided in the book. Only Frogs who have only A-level characteristics are considered - according to his book - A-class employees, and these individuals form the basis of a high-performance culture.

Every 90 days, you should challenge yourself to focus on THREE of these components:

* One for the whole company, which you will take action to help improve.
* One you set for yourself.
* One set by another Frog (your direct report?), as you may not know what you need to change yourself.

Keep a written tally of your experience and growth in these three areas. 

Feel free to challenge yourself on all of them!
