# Absenteeism

> If you are not working when you are reasonably expected to be working, you are absent or late.

*In order to be successful as an organization, wherever possible, people need to be contributing consistently at an expected level, or our team suffers. There is a reasonable expectation for our mutual success that you will be working when you say you will be and where you say you will be.*

Treefrog has [flexible hours](hours.md) for most positions with the exception of positions that are critical to client-facing localized hours (e.g. tech support, front desk, etc.) for reasons of [customer-service](manual/customer-service.md). However, if you have set an expectation to be at Treefrog at a certain time, other Frogs will be counting on you being there. By not being available when you have promised to be, you increase the [cost-of-chaos](manual/cost-of-chaos.md) and reduce the overall effectiveness of the team.

Frogs are responsible for contacting his or her [Pod Champion](manual/pod-champion.md) before the start of the Pod Champion's regular committed hours if a Frog is going to be absent or late. Frogs can be absent or late because of any of the following:

1. [Sickness](sickdays.md)
2. An emergency (an accident)
3. Inclement weather
4. Traffic issues
5. Child or pet-related [illness](sickdays.md) or [emergency](emergencyleave.md)
6. etc.

Many of these specifics are covered within its own section of the Manual.

### What to do is you are Expecting to be Absent

> Absence due to tardiness must be made up based on a schedule approved by your Pod Leader.

You must notify your [Pod Champion](manual/pod-champion.md) about time required off for personal appointments at least 48 hours prior to the time missed. Appointments should be made at the beginning or end of day whenever possible. Excused time off for appointments must be made up by working alternative hours, and these hours must be approved by your [Pod Champion](manual/pod-champion.md). Absolutely you can take off time to go to the doctor. Just don't let it hurt everyone else while you are at it.

#### Slack Warnings

If you are going to be late, need to take moments off, or feel sick, etc, please make a point of letting the team know in the below channel on Slack:

[Absent Channel](https://treefrog.slack.com/messages/absent/)

1. **You *must* notify** - There needs to be a record of why you are absent. Otherwise, you cost other people time and energy. Slack is fine for this.

2. **Mimimum 24 Hours Notice** - Our Manual states that you need to give at least 24 hours notice for time off. We are pretty lenient with this idea (Frog for Life!), but it is helpful to the team to have advance warning - not as a measure of bureaucracy but of mutual respect and love. 48 hours would be much more respectful. A week would actually be the most professional.

3. **Notification a few days ahead of time is commensurate with team productivity** - Telling people 3 months ahead of time that you will not be available and then failing to remind them does not help. Warn people several times in reaonable measure with the anticipated activity.

4. **You do not need to watch this channel unless you need to watch this channel** - Do not follow the channel unless you need to. You should not need to follow the channel (Cost of Chaos!), but rather, go in and look if you are wondering where people are. Exclusions are communication hubs, i.e. Front Desk.

5. **Reach out to critical people in your warning** - Make sure you reach out to people you will be affecting, especially your pod. You might even additionally post to your pod channel if it is a heavy/confusing week.

6. **Tell people why** - Please also indicate why. If it is a private issue, please just note something general so people are not left wondering, confused, and/or conflicted. Imagine the impact on your pod if you could be headed into something of serious impact. An issue, such as, "I am having an emergency bypass", although this issue is appropriate to keep to yourself, has an obviously greater impact than "There is an emergency sale on shoes at The Bay, and I will be catching up later this evening on my hours".

#### Examples of Appropriate Messages:

- "Reminder: I will be out for a doctor's appointment tomorrow after 3:00pm. Just a checkup. Call or Slack with emergencies 905-392-6997 ATTN: @Kevin"
- "I have a migraine, and so, I need to go home. I should be in tomorrow. My migraines usually only last a day. Slack only, I will check in when the pain subsides. ATTN: @Jim"

####Some reminders for all involved:

- If you are sick, get better. If you need to go to a doctor or dentist, do not wait. We work around one another.
- Working from home is a privilege, not a right. Not being here makes you more difficult to communicate with and less likely to help Treefrog and yourself be successful. Only work from home if it is absolutely necessary, not because it would be nice.
- Getting an appointment late or early in the day is usually achieved by simply asking for it. This saves you from a complete-day-meltdown. Ask for it, and come to work for as long as possible.

We do not want Treefrog to be antagonistic towards life. However, we do not want life to be antagonistic towards Treefrog. These can and should be in harmonious balance and can be achieved through communication to the right people at the right time.

### Excessive Absences

> If you are unexpectedly absent three weeks in a row, something is funky. It's time to chat with your Pod Leader.

When a Frog’s absences are both high in number and the frequency of personal absences becomes excessive as compared to the company’s average or the absences establish a pattern, for example, Mondays, or several every week for weeks on end, the Frog’s absenteeism will be considered **excessive**. This can be for any rational or explainable reason (chronic car issues, or chronic traffic issues, or multiple weddings in a row - you name it) - it's still excessive, no matter how delicate or intricate or legitimate the excuse. Work shouldn't be antagonist towards life, but life choices (like living far away, or being deeply involved in 20 weddings or six theatrical events) shouldn't also cripple your paid productivity.

Frogs with excessive absences will receive a letter that is issued by his or her [Pod Champion](manual/pod-champion.md) and that will detail attendance records and set performance expectations over a defined period of time.

If absences continue, a further meeting will be held to identify the reasons for the ongoing absences. Each case will be reviewed individually, and appropriate steps will be taken in accordance to the severity of the issue.

Majority of the work done at Treefrog is interdependent on co-workers. Therefore, it is extremely important that each Frog is punctual and consistent with his or her schedule. Habitually arriving late for work is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action.
