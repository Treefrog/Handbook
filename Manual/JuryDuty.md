# Court or Jury Duty

> Go do your duty. But we can't afford to pay for it.

Treefrog will excuse Frogs from work for court or jury duty. Any Frog called by a court or subpoenaed to attend as a witness, will be given the time off work to meet this obligation. Upon selection for such duty, the Frog must notify the CEO immediately. If attendance at the court is not required on any given day, or if the Frog is dismissed from the court before the end of the work day, the Frog is expected to report to work and carry out his or her office responsibilties for the remainder of that day.
