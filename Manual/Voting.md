# Voting in Federal, Provincial or Municipal Elections

> The Rule of Thumb

*Every Canadian citizen, 18 years or older on polling day is entitled to vote. If you are over 18, go vote.*

We do encourage all frogs to fulfill their civic obligations. Qualified electors are entitled to three consecutive hours, while the polls are open, during which to vote. This doesn't mean you get to come into work 3 hours late on voting day or leave 3 hours early on voting day. What it does mean is that if your work schedule that day prevents you from having 3 consecutive hours off to vote, then we will give you the time off to fulfill your duty.

### Three Consecutive Hours
The following are examples of what time off to vote looks like when voting hours (ie.polls open) are 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m:

- The employee works from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. – no time off required because the employee has 4.5 consecutive hours off of work to the time polls close at 8:30 p.m.
- The employee works from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. – no time off required because the employee has three consecutive hours off of work to the time polls close at 8:30 p.m.
- The employee works from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. – the employee may be permitted to arrive late or leave early to provide three consecutive hours off of work.

Treefrog has the right to decide what time off to provide to frogs in order to meet the required three consecutive hours (if required) and is under no obligation to make allowance for frogs' "travel time" to vote.
