# Pregnancy and Parental Leave

> Take some time to enjoy your new baby.

### Pregnancy Leave

Treefrog provides pregnancy leaves of absence without pay to all eligible employees according to the guidelines set out in Ontario’s Employment Standards Act. An employee is entitled to 17 weeks of unpaid leave of absence for pregnancy if they have employed her for at least 13 weeks preceding the expected date of delivery. The leave may not begin before 17 weeks prior to the expected date of delivery. The employee would be eligible to collect employment insurance benefits.

An employee entitled to the leave must give at least 2 weeks’ notice in writing of the date the leave is to begin, along with a medical certificate estimating the date of delivery. In the case of pregnancy complications or premature birth, the 2-week notice will be waived. If the employee does not specify the end date of the pregnancy leave, it will be assumed that she wishes to take the maximum leave of 17 weeks. An employee returning to work may change the date to return earlier or later (within the 17 week maximum) if written notice is sent to the Company at least 4 weeks prior to the original date of return.

### Parental Leave

Parental leave is another job protected leave under the ESA. A Frog who is a parent and has been employed for at least 13 weeks is entitled to 35 weeks of unpaid parental leave following the birth of the child or 37 weeks for non-birth parents. A Frog who is entitled to parental leave must provide notice in writing at least two weeks before the leave is scheduled to commence. If he or she does not state when the leave will end, it will be assumed that he or she wishes to take the maximum leave.

We are cognizant that pregnancy and child-bearing is a beautiful, natural, and important process, and we want to work together with you to ensure the child is cared for appropriately. Different newborns and different parents have different needs. Let us work through this together.

> The kid makes the rules, not you. Keep us in the loop!

Also note that we are aware that, under most circumstances, the complexities of child birth and return-to-work dynamics are often filled with twists and turns - and the more Treefrog knows about your twists and turns, the more we can be adquately prepared for your return. Stay in touch!

### Parental Leave Options

Special projects may be able to be arranged for Frogs who are interested in working from home while caring for his or her new baby. This is highly contingent on your role, skills, and the work available at Treefrog.

#### Holidays and Pregnancy and Parental Leave

#### Benefits and Pregnancy and Parental Leave

If a Frog wishes to continue their benefits during their leave, they will be required to continue to pay the premiums on their own.
