# Productivity Flags

> Productivity Rhythms are like Sleep

One of my new theories that I have espoused to many of you individually, is that productivity during the day is similar to getting a good sleep. Sure, if you go to bed for 8 hours you should theoretically be rested and perky the next day. But merely lying in bed does not equal sleep. If you wake up every 15 minutes all night, you can be in bed for 12 hours and still be exhausted the next day. On the other hand, sometimes 6 hours of pure, unbothered sleep is enough to make you feel magnificent. The human body needs several sets of 3 hour chunks and then some smaller reps to fully realize rest. It is the natural rhythm and flow of life.

The same goes for productivity. You can sit in your chair all day, bothered all day long by the Time Cuisinart™ of the open office plan and get nothing done. I'm sure all of you have had that feeling where you have been at work all day and at the end of the day, your to-do list is not any shorter than when it started. It is deeply unsatisfactory and unproductive to be bothered all day. But we do not control this. We have no system for protecting one another's productivity.

We need blocks of 3 hours of productivity, or more, to accomplish major tasks well.

There is also the additional double-edged sword that we have a very open and transparent culture and a sardine-tin like desk environment. There are no cubicles here. Cubicles forcibly enhance productivity while simultaneously crushing your soul and creativity. We naturally bug one another all day and want to stay open for one another as a team, while also wanting to do great work.

We also have a whole whack of methodologies for chronic disturbation:

- Physically (tapped on shoulder)
- Phone (I demand your attention NOW!)
- Email (The every-few-minutes oxytocin rush from the positive thrill of a new email)
- iChat (A nice way to time-warp questions directly but still an intrusion)
- Open office discussion (I do not want to miss anything!)

In order to be successful, strong team productivity skills are critical. It is not enough to have mutual skill sets that enable us to complete larger works as a group. It is not enough to have one another's backs. We also need to protect one another's ability to do work without being bothered.

### Treefrog Today

How we have been handling this until today is easy, we come in early, or we stay late, or we work from home. Several years ago, we thought getting headphones for everyone would be a good marker. But headphones are not an indicator of anything other than the joy of music. Plus, many people found/find them uncomfortable, and some people want to listen to music when they are openly available anyway. (I also don't have any evidence that listening to music enhances productivity?)

Staying at home doesn't improve your productivity. It merely increases your control over your own productivity as there are fewer uncontrolled distractions that leads to improved productivity. (Sure, Netflix is always there beckoning, but you can control the urge).

Ergo, I have introduced a new funky idea of Productivity Flags. I distributed them this week when they arrived and thought I would share some ideas for them:

There are three colors:

1. **Green**: "I am available to chat if you need me". (Open mode)

2. **Yellow**: "I am busy, but if you need to bug me you can, if necessary". (Head-down mode)

3. **Red**: "If you bother me, you are going to prevent me from doing my job properly. I will be grumpy and point at the flag. Someone had better be bleeding the same color as the damn flag because you are bugging me during a critical time." (Red mode)

**When Red disturbing might be appropriate**: 

- Emergency (Fire, Bleeding, Nuclear Fallout, etc.)
- Some job is completely at a standstill and it is mission-critical to complete it. 
- Your own productivity is significantly compromised or at a standstill.

**Some other ideas**:

- Red flags should be used sparingly. Yellow flags will be respected similarly. Red flags are only for critical times.
- If you are not at work, take your flag down.
- If you are in the building, or out to lunch, turn the Flag to 45 degrees representing that you are in the boardroom, for example, not gone for the day.
- There are not enough Red flags to go around. Because, of course, we have to support clients. Pod leaders should be making sure that his or her whole pod does not shut off to client requests because that would not be the Frogness.
- If you see red or yellow flags waving, keep the local noise down. (e.g. leave the room to have a discussion).
- Be sensitive that others need you to be "green flagged" some times. We will not set rules around minimum "green-flagginess" if people respect the Flag.
- It is OK if the Flag touches the ground. You do not need to burn it.
- If you go networking, take a green Flag with you for picture ops.
- If you go on holiday, take a red flag for picture ops. ;)

More ideas are welcome!

**Other suggestions for productivity**

- Try to set aside at least two 3-hour blocks a week to be in head-down (yellow) mode. Maybe even one a day. Make these times consistent so people know not to bug you.
- Set a natural rhythm for your own productivity, and let the world know. For example, check your email three times daily and try to be consistent about it. Get away from chronic email checking.
- If you need regular input from another Frog, schedule it regularly (e.g. meet once a week at a regularized time). Do not bug the individual about your issue unless it absolutely cannot wait.
- Set agendas for your meetings and stick to accomplishing the goal of your agenda..
- Eat The Frog First. Do the thing you are dreading to do first. Get it off your list. Then the rest of your time will be easier to deal with. “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” - Mark Twain
More suggestions are welcome!

Hopefully, with some good ole fashioned Treefrog creativity, these flags will radically help us improve as a team, minimizing frustration and maximizing job satisfaction and productivity.
