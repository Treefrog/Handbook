# Attitude

> Success at Treefrog is all about Attitude

*Once you've read through this manual - you should realize that the difference between success and failure at Treefrog is simply having a Frog-like attitude.*

```
Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.
- Zig Ziglar

The success of any organization is based on the individual success of each person in that organization.Â Our combined attitude is only as good as the least favourable attitude in the company. We ask that all Frogs continually remind themselves of this and hold each other accountable for his or her attitude and overall perception. This includes all Frogs' attitudes about the workplace, our clients, and fellow Frogs either at home, at work, and especially, in public.

Treefrog will continue to achieve and would like all Frogs to achieve with us as a team. We all need to be deeply respectful of one another and understand what that means.
