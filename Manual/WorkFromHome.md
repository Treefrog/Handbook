# Work From Home

> You are not as valuable to Treefrog when you work from home. So, do not do work from home.

Every once and a while, working from home can be a nice change. The effect of that nice change is that you have the perception that you are super-productive despite the cost of others being less productive. However, once staying at home becomes a habit, your productiveness and value to the team overall decreases exponentially.

Working from home causes the following negative issues:

1. **Communication** - Communication with your team members is radically reduced. Although some communication can happen through technology, person-to-person contact is still the most effective mechanism for understanding. We have proven this time and time again.
2. **Positive Relationships** - Your overall relationship with members of the team is reduced when you stay at home. Further, there is a decrease in the efficiency in the ability of team members to communictae with you. We hire people we like being around. We do not want you staying at home. We want you here so that we can enjoy life together.
3. **Efficiency** - You do not have access to universal equipment, like the file server, when you are at home. You get more done and are thus more valuable when you have access to the team and to our trappings. There is a tangible proximity effect.
4. **Accessibility** - You may have something we need. For example, a piece of information or a password. We may have something you need. Your body is the company's interface to your head. This is what we are paying for.
5. **Agility** - Things are constantly changing around Treefrog. If you are not here, you cannot help the team be agile when clients change their minds, processes change, or project timelines change.
6. **Trust** - Everybody does a little laundry when they are "working from home". Then, a quick break to watch some TV in the background (See: [Distractions](manual/Distractions)), a quick dog walk, and then maybe a little snooze, and suddenly, a few hours have gone by. You may believe that this makes you much more perky and functional but it does not - especially if you do it a few days in a row. You are fooling yourself. It is a slippery slope that the best of us have slid down.
7. **Effect on Others** - Sure, you do not get bugged when you work from home. That is because other people are being bugged in your place. And now, it has a multiplier effect. Not only do Frogs not have the information you have, but also the Frog's own work is compromised. You are making other people less productive.

We are much more efficient if we are all working together face-to-face. Treefrog has spent a lot of money, time, and effort trying to make a space where we can all be effective. Let us not waste it.

### Emergency Work From Home

If you have a critical reason to stay home to work (you need to look after a litter of new-born ferrets whose mother died in a freak house-cleaning incident, or your gas pipes burst and you need to stay home to let the fire department stand around and smoke), you have a few options involving *not working*:

1. If you have holiday time, you can take a day off as holiday.
2. If you do not have holiday time, you can request special permission to not get paid that day *This cannot happen regularly because of [the-cost-of-people](manual/the-cost-of-people.md).
3. You can make the work up in the evening or on weekends.
4. You can make very specific arrangements with your Champion to work from home this once.*

*There needs to be a genuine emergency for this to happen. Looking after your dog is not an emergency - It is a life choice. If you failed to make good decisions that would allow you to come to work every day, you need to make different life decisions or set up your life so that you can still be a remarkable Frog.

### Bummed Out

Every once in a while we feel like staying home because we are bummed out or because we had a disagreement with a fellow Frog or client and do not feel like dealing with it. Situations can get complex when so many people work together, and this can make it difficult to be effective.

If you believe you are suffering from depression, please seek medical help immediately. This plagues most of us, especially during the long winter months, and you may need couselling or medication.

If you need a day off and your Pod can handle the work load in your absence, then take a [vacation](manual/vacation.md) day. Take a break. We all need a break from time to time.

Otherwise, gut-up. This is not a daycare. This is a job, and you should be present for it. The definition of a professional is someone who does his or her best work on his or her worst day.

### Work From Home Because You Would Like To

Once in a while, if you would like to work from home to accomplish a specific, meaningful, and long-term task, you may work from home if your Champion believes that you can work from home this one time given your work load, under the following conditions:

1. Consider the implications to your team and projects
2. Ask permission to do so
3. Do not work from home on Mondays or Fridays - it smells like cheating
4. Do not work from home two consecutive days in a row
5. Stay in communication at all times with your Champion*

*If at some point you turn off your phone or communication line with your Champion, you are not working.

Please be cognizant that working from home can easily persuade you from actually working - the pull of dishes, vacuuming, television, coffee, and more, can be too much to bear. "All I need to do is a few more loads of laundry, and then I can get back to work" is not acceptable when working from home.

### Inclement Weather

In the event that weather conditions are severe and you are unable to safely make it into the office, you may request to work from home. Frogs must notify the office prior to the beginning of their schedule and speak with their [Pod-Champion](manual/pod-champion.md). At this time, an alternate schedule for the day can be agreed upon. If a Frog is working from home, he or she is still required to complete a full day of work and log his or her time into the “FrogWeb” timesheet system. In the event that a regular working day is not completed, the non-working portion of the day will be considered vacation time and should be recorded to reflect this.

When inclement weather occurs, stay safe. There is too much paperwork if you die in a horrible snow-ball-related winter death. However, realize that Treefrog wants you to [live-close](manual/live-close.md) to the office so that this is not an issue.

Technically, Frogs should be able to survive the winter without problems. There are five known species of freeze-tolerant frogs in North America, including the well-studied wood frog, the Cope’s gray tree frog, the eastern gray tree frog, spring peepers frog, and the western chorus frog. In the fall, these frogs bury themselves under the leaves on the forest floor, not deeply enough, however, to escape the icy fingers of Jack Frost.
