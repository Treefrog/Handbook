# Frog Alumni

> If you make it through 1.5 years, you are alumni.

*Major contributors to Treefrog get special recognition.*

If you've been a major contributor to Treefrog, and stuck it out through thick and thin, you will have a place in our hearts forever. You are always welcome to come back and hang out, and drink our beer.

You become Frog alumni if the following conditions are met;

- 1.5 Years (18 Months) consecutive at Treefrog
- Transitioned, not Quit

That's not to say you otherwise aren't welcome here if you have worked here in the past - you just don't get recognized for it.
