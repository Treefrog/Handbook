# Conflicts of Interest

> You shouldn't be doing things outside of work that Treefrog pays you to do for clients.

Conflicts of interest arise when a Frog becomes involved in any business or other activity that may conflict with the best interests of Treefrog, other Frogs or clients, or in any way, interfere with the Frog’s ability to completely carry out his or her responsibilities.

Our policy is to conduct business ethically and to avoid conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts. All Frogs have an equal duty to avoid conflicts of interest. You must fully disclose and refrain from engaging in any activities that create a conflict of interest between your personal interests and the interests of the company. You are expected to report conflicts of interest to the CEO immediately upon discovery or suspicion of a conflict.

Conflicts include, but are not limited to, the following situations:

* **Direct Conflict of Interest** - Ownership by you or a family member of a substantial financial interest in any outside concern that does business with, or is a competitor to, Treefrog (except where such interest consists of an insubstantial percentage of a publicly-owned corporation). *If you are doing something on the side that Treefrog does, you are in conflict.*

- [Exclusive Service](exclusiveservice.md) - Rendering services to any outside concern, including your own or that of a family member, that does business with or is a competitor of Treefrog.

- [Moonlighting](exclusiveservice.md) - Having other employment or another job that may be performed in off-hours (also known as “moonlighting”) regardless of whether the second employer is a competitor of Treefrog without prior approval.

- [Inducements](Inducements.md) Acceptance by you or a family member of gifts (of more than token value), loans, (other than from established financial institutions), excessive entertainment, or other substantial favours from any outside concern that does business with, or is seeking to do business with, or is a competitor of Treefrog.
