# Mail Service

> Treefrog shouldn't be paying for you to send your personal mail.

Postage and mail delivery charges incurred while conducting company business are covered through Treefrog. If for a client, please ensure these are billed back to the project.

Treefrog is not obligated to accept COD deliveries for personal items. If you don't warn the front desk that it is incoming, we will turn it away. Maybe it's a scam?
