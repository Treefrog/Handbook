# Safety

> We want our Frogs to be happy, healthy, and productive. We will do everything possible to ensure our Frogs' safety while they are at work.

### Don't be Alone at Treefrog

Unless absolutely necessary, you should never be alone at Treefrog. If you are alone at Treefrog, especially at night, call another Frog to join you and/or lock all of the doors and alarm the building with the "I am home" alarm button.

You shouldn't be at Treefrog at night by yourself. Ever. In fact - why are you at Treefrog at night? That seems weird as well.

### Unwelcome Guest List

Treefrog's wish is to keep all of the Frogs employed with Treefrog forever. This includes ensuring you are fed, watered, and safe.

Part of this commitment is a commitment to your safety. Note that the policies below are for your safety and might seem "extreme". Treefrog wants to protect you all and to make certain Treefrog is a safe and happy environment for all. We are not going to mess with any possibility of anything bad occuring. We will have no tolerance for the presence of people at Treefrog who do not make us feel safe - kaput.

Our policy for unwelcome guests is as follows:

1) Should an unwelcome individual approach Treefrog, we follow the below in advance:

- Lock the doors and go inside.
- Do not provoke or play hero in any way.
- Call the Police (subtly).
- If possible, subtly warn any relevant individuals to "go to the bathroom".

2) Should the individual in question enter Treefrog, we will:

- Indicate that the person he or she is looking for is not available ("with a client, doing business"), and we will have the Frog he or she is wishing to contact know that this individual came to the office.
- Do not provoke or play hero in any way. Strike up a natural and meaningless conversation.
- Sublty, call the Police if need be.
- If possible, subtly warn any relevant individuals to "go to the bathroom".

This is an intentional over-reaction to ensure everyone's safety. Taking unwelcome individuals seriously ensures that we are prepared and that we do not panic.

Treefrog is a place of safety for everyone. We are not going to try and negotiate, placate, or play hero and hope the individual goes away on his or her own accord. To deal with unwelcome human guests, we have a wonderful, trained, and tactically prepared group of individuals known as, the police. Ironically, squirrels are more difficult and more expensive to get rid of than people. You do not need to think twice - call the police. The police are super-nice people and will completely understand that you have called them because you didn't feel safe.

If anyone feels unsafe at any time for any reason at Treefrog or outside of Treefrog, please communicate with the CEO, and we will make arrangements to ensure your safety. We will work together to create a safety plan for you, and if necessary, we will assist you in getting help through agencies who are better equipped to support you. We have each other's backs. This is the Frog way.

In addition, during a period where a specific Frog feels unsafe, we will take additional measures to ensure his or her safety.

### Ergonomics
