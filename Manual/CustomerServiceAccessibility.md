# Accessible Customer Service

> The Rule of Thumb

*Treefrog is committed to excellence in serving all people with disabilities.*

We strive to provide our goods, services and facilities in a respectful and accessible manner to all of our clients, including persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities will benefit from the same services, in the same place, in a similar way, as other clients. It is the commitment of Treefrog to provide equitable treatment, with respect to providing our goods and services without discrimination in accordance with The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 11 and the Ontario Regulation, O. Reg. 191/11: INTEGRATED ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS and the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Our accessiblity standards for customer service will be guided by the following principles:

Dignity: service is provided in a way that allows the person with a disability to maintain self-respect and the respect of other people. People with disabilities are not treated as an afterthought or forced to accept lesser service, quality or convenience.

Independence: allowing a person with a disability to do things on their own without unnecessary help, or interference from others.

Integration: service is provided in a way that allows the person with a disability to benefit from the same services, in the same place, and in the same or similar way as other customers, unless an alternate measure is necessary to enable the person to access goods or services.

Equal Opportunity: people with disabilities have an opportunity equal to that given to others to access our goods and services.

### Assistive Devices

We will ensure that people with Assistive Devices have access to our building.

### Communication

We will communicate with people with disabilities, to the best of our ability, in ways that take into account their disability and offer communication methods that are suitable to their communication needs (i.e. e-mail, telephone, or in-person, etc.).


### Service Animals

We welcome people with disabilities and their service animals. (Service animals are allowed on parts of the premises that are open to the public).

### Support Person

A support person is an individual hired or chosen by a person with a disability to accompany him or her in order to help with communication, mobility, personal care, medical needs or with access to goods or services. A person with a disability who is accompanied by a support person will be allowed to have that person accompany them on our premises.

### Notice of Temporary Disruption

In the event of a planned or unexpected disruption to our services, Treefrog will post a notice in near proximity to the front door entrance and will include as much information as possible (should include the reason for the disruption, length and description of alternative facilities or services if available). People with disabilities may use the front entrance and call our Front Reception for further assistance.

### Training

Treefrog will provide training to all frogs and volunteers.

### Feedback Process

People with disabilities who wish to provide feedback on the way Treefrog provides accessibility to our premises and/or general communication are encouraged to do so by phoning our main number and requesting to speak the frog in charge of providing services to people with disabilities. This frog will ensure that our feedback process is accessible by providing or arranging for accessible formats and communication supports, if requested. All feedback, including complaints, will be handled by this frog and will respond back within one week of receiving the feedback.

### Notice of Availability

Treefrog will notify people with disabilities that our policies are available upon request by calling our main number and requesting to speak with the frog in charge of providing services to people with disabilities. This frog will ensure that the information requested is provided in an accessible format and/or communication support that meets the needs of the person with a disability to receive our policies, and will follow-up to ensure the person with a disability is satisfied with the method in which he or she received our policies.
