# Diversity

> Everyone has an equal right to being a Frog.

We celebrate diversity and embrace the creativity that comes from being open to a broad range of cultures, ideas, and opinions.

### Equal Opportunity

Treefrog maintains a policy of non-discrimination for all Frogs and job applicants. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, and all terms of employment. Applications are encouraged from all persons including persons with disabilities and all persons will be made aware that accommodations are available, if required. We will not discriminate on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status, disability, or any other grounds prohibited by the applicable Human Rights legislation. All aspects of employment will be governed on the basis of individual experience, skills, ability, attitude, and potential, without bias or prejudice.

### Gender Discrimination vs. Recognition

Although we do not discriminate on gender, we do expect (for reasons of cultural appropriateness and according to [sexual harassment](harassment.md) that different genders have different needs. For example, in bathroom usage, matching plumbing to plumbing is not discrimination - it is plumbing.

### Washrooms and Gender

1. Do not worry about it - he or she knows better than you.
