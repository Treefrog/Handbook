### Pet Emergencies

> We love dogs and cats, too. But your pet is your cost.

Treefrog recognizes and appreciates that pets are sources of great happiness and stress relief. However, unlike family members, pets tend to have shorter life spans and are a life choice. You pick your pet; you do not pick your family. The burden of this life choice falls to you, not to the Frogs. Any work time lost due to pet-related emergencies must be managed through as a vacation day or be made up through additional worked hours.
