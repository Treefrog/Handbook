# Personal Appointments

> Be smart about your appointments.

<i>The whole point of Treefrog is to make life better for you - to allow you to take time off if you need it.</i>

But that doesn't mean to say you should abuse the system.

Frogs are strongly encouraged to ,make appointments at the beginning or the end of the day - or on a lunch break - so you can minimize the negative efect on the team. If frogs have to schedule appointments during work times, they are required to provide a minimum of two (2) weeks’ advance notice of the appointment in writing to their pod leader. Again, if possible, choose an appointment time which will cause the least disruption, such as the beginning or end of the day.  If it is anticipated that a frog may return to work from an appointment later than expected, they are required to call in to the office and speak to thier pod leader and let them know they are running late.
