# Phone Expenses

> Treefrog pays it's phone share.

*If you MUST have a phone for work, or you incur visible expenses you otherwise wouldn't due to Treefrog's involvement, we'll pay Treefrog's share.*

Treefrog does not reimburse phone charges to Frogs that do not absolutely require a phone for their position. Examples that do;

- 24/7 Emergency Tech Support (read: Matt)

If a cell phone is required for your role, this will be discussed with you upon hire or upon change of your responsibility. We prefer you supply your own phone and number, but if you do not have one, Treefrog will provide one at which time it will be used exclusively for business purposes only and may be requested back at any time. If we buy you a phone, it belongs to Treefrog. Obviously.

Maximum reimbursement for cell phones is $60/month, if required for your role, which is enough to cover pretty much any need.
