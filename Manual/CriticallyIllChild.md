# Critically Ill Child Care Leave

> The Rule of Thumb

*If your child becomes critically ill, you don't need to be here - it's clear where you need to be.*

This is another unpaid, job protected leave under the ESA. The Critically-ill Child Care Leave is available to frogs with six (6) consecutive months of employment. Frogs could be entitled to an unpaid job protected leave of 37-52 weeks depending on the care needed for the child as determined by a qualified health practitioner. In order to be eligible, a qualified health practitioner must issue a certificate that:

•	states that the child is a critically ill child who requires the care or support of one or more parents; and
•	sets out the period during which the child requires the care or support.

The maximum leave that would be available to a frog to provide care for a critically ill child is 37 weeks. However, if the certificate from the qualified health practitioner sets out a shorter time for which the child requires care or support, then that period of time would be the maximum available. If the period specified in the physician’s certificate is 52 weeks or longer, the leave will end on the last day of the 52 week period.

If this is you, come see the CEO immediately. You will have full support.
