*If you smart commute to work, we will pay you.*

#### Live Close

It is safer and better if you live close to Treefrog for a number of reasons:

- **Commuting is Stupid** - Your life does not waste away commuting.
- **The Environment is being Damaged** - You do less damage to the environment.
- **You are Safer** - You are safer because you are less likely to get damaged in a vehicular accident.
- **You are part of our Family** - You will be more likely to interact with other Frogs in your extra time. This will better connect you with the rest of the team.
- **Emergencies Arise** - You can get home faster in an emergency - like severe diarrhea.

Treefrog will actively promote your living closer in any reasonable way possible (helping you move!), and additionally, Treefrog will consider your living proximity to Treefrog when hiring you for the reasons stated above.
