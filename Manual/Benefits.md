# Benefits

> We want all Frogs to be healthy and protected from harm.

*Sickness and bad things happen to good people. We should accept this and try to leverage the size of Treefrog to help the whole team look and feel better as much as we can.*

The following is a brief description of Treefrog’s benefit program. Upon eligibility, you will receive a more detailed and comprehensive package. All full-time Frogs are eligible to participate in the program following his or her 3-month observation period. Participation in the program is mandatory unless proper documentation is provided detailing involvement in a spouse’s benefit plan. Benefit programs are in place for:

1. Extended Health Care
2. Dental Care
3. Long Term Disability

All dental and health forms should be submitted directly to the provider and directly by Frogs. Any changes to personal data, including dependent information, needs to be communicated promptly to the Controller to avoid interruptions in benefit involvement.

### Everyone Must Comply

Not only because our benefits providers require it but also because we genuinely want people to be happy and healthy. We are not going to help you avoid the system just because you think you are bullet-proof or luckier than other people. 

Everybody gets sick. Everybody has issues. We want everyone to be protected.

### Voting for Benefits

As benefits are a shared cost between us all, Frogs should be given reaonable input every few years to ensure that the benefits we, as a company, have chosen are relevant and equitable to all Frogs who partake in the program.

These voting realities do need to be balanced with the capacity of the company to afford them, lest we all go down with the ship and can no longer provide meaningful benefits for anyone.

### Use Benefits When Appropriate, Not Just Because

One often forgotten reality is that *benefit rates are commensurate with usage*. This point is not made to deter your use of preventative and appropriate preventative measures, for example, massage therapy or naturopathy, but rather, to be reaonable in your use of said services commensurate with your needs. 

In other words, there is a net effect to the whole team if you abuse the system. Therefore, do not abuse the system.

###Examples

1. We had a Frog who voted that Long Term Disability was a waste of money and soon after developed cancer. Ironically, the lack of LTD required the person to quit and pursue an alternate career.

2. We had a Frog suggest that *"There are only 7 days left in the calendar year! Everyone should go and get as many massages as possible!"*. Yes, massage therapy is good for you, can reduce stress, and can be a preventative to future issues. However, getting 5 massages in 7 days does not exponentially improve your health. Please be aware that the sudden influx of unnecessary massages increased our individual rates by $7 each the next year. Ironically, this situation caused everyone increased stress and thus, the need for massages. *Use the appropriate health professionals when appropriate.*
