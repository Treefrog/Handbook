# Benefits

> We want all Frogs to be healthy and protected from harm.

All full-time Frogs are eligible to participate in our Treefrog Benefits plan following their 3 month probation period. Upon eligibility, you will receive a more detailed and comprehensive plan overview. 

All dental and health forms should be submitted directly to the provider by Frogs. With the exception of vision care.

Any changes to personal data, including dependent information, needs to be communicated promptly to the Manager, Talent and Culture to avoid interruptions in benefit involvement.


### Everyone Must Participate 

As per our policy, participation in the Treefrog benefits plan is mandatory unless you have coverage under a spouse's extended health care plan. 

If you are covered under a spouse's plan, Health, Dental and life insurance can be waived but Long Term Disability (LTD) and Accidental (ADD) insurances are mandatory. 


### Voting for Benefits

As benefits are a shared cost between us all, Frogs should be given reaonable input every few years to ensure that the benefits we, as a company, have chosen are relevant and equitable to all Frogs who partake in the program.

These voting realities do need to be balanced with the capacity of the company to afford them, lest we all go down with the ship and can no longer provide meaningful benefits for anyone.

### Use Benefits When Appropriate, Not Just Because

One often forgotten reality is that *benefit rates are commensurate with usage*. This point is not made to deter your use of preventative and appropriate preventative measures, for example, massage therapy or naturopathy, but rather, to be reaonable in your use of said services commensurate with your needs.

In other words, there is a net effect to the whole team if you abuse the system. Therefore, do not abuse the system.

### Vision Care 

Our Treefrog benefits plan does cover eye exams, however, it does not cover vision care as it is relates to prescription glasses, contacts etcâ€¦ 

We believe that vision care is imperative to the overall health of our Frogs. After review and negotiation, Treefrog found it was not in our best interest to add this to our current plan but to add a wellness reimbursement for vision care independently. Treefrog, therefore will allow Frogs to expense vision care up to a maximum of $200 every two years for prescription, glasses, sun glasses or contact lenses. 

This expense is available to all full-time permanent Frogs who are participating in our Treefrog Benefit plan. Eligible reimbursements will be for prescription eyewear. Treefrog reserved the right to investigate expenses and deny any submissions not inline with the policy. 
The two year cycle will begin on your hire date and renew every two years on your frogiversary. 

Frogs must pay for the expense up front and submit an expense report (found here) within 30 days of the accrued expense. More information in "Expenses".

Being cognisant that vision care prices vary within the market, we encourage all Frogs to do their own research on pricing and take a look at the following companies when ordering prescription glasses as they are cost effective online businesses.
