# Office Supplies

> Office Supplies are not for use at your home.

Office supplies are kept in the downstairs area by the washrooms. Frogs are welcome to use these supplies when needed for office use only. These supplies are not to be taken home, or used for personal use.

If you have a request for an item thatâ€™s not in the supply area, you will need approval from your Pod Leader. Once you have approval, please send a request through to Client Care. We are happy to get you anything that will increase your efficiency or happiness (within reason).
