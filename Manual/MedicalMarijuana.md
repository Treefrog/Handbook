# Medical Marijuana

> The Rule of Thumb

*We will work with any frog who requests accommodation for the use of medical marijuana as prescribed by their doctor.*

Treefrog will work with any frog who requests accommodation to use medical marijuana in an effort to ensure that any accommodation measures are effective, consistent with the frog’s medical needs, and operationally feasible, having regard for safety and cost. Medical marijuana will be treated the same as all other prescription medication. We haves the same expectations from frogs who use medical marijuana as who use all other types of medication and will accommodate individuals up to the point of undue hardship and having regard to the safety of all other frogs.

Employees may only use medical marijuana with a license in their name from a duly qualified physician. If frog is required to use medical marijuana while at work, he/she must inform the CEO. A frog is not required to disclose the specific medical diagnosis or condition for which the medical marijuana is required. However, they are required to provide a note from his/her physician which includes the following information:
•	confirmation that the employee's use of medical marijuana is medically necessary;
•	information about the recommended frequency and dosage of the marijuana use;
•	confirmation that the required dosage and frequency of use will not negatively impact the employee’s ability to safely perform the job;  and
•	a copy of the possession license.

All information provided to Treefrog in regard to medical marijuana use is considered confidential and will be disclosed only as required in order to assess the frog’s request and address accommodation measures. In determining the accommodation, frogs may be required to work with any third parties, including medical consultants, who are engaged to provide direction and support for the use of medical marijuana. Accommodation plans relating to the use of medical marijuana may be reviewed and revised where it appears that the use of medical marijuana is having a significant negative impact on the employee’s job performance or is creating a safety hazard for the frog or other frogs.

In the event that the use of medical marijuana is deemed to pose a potential hazard to the safety of the frog and/or other frogs, it may be necessary for the parties to consider re-assigning the frog to a non-safety-sensitive position on a temporary or permanent basis.

In the event that an employee is taking medical marijuana during regular working hours, he/she is expected to use it in moderation, only at the recommended level of dosage and the applicable frequency of the doses. Treefrog expects that, where possible, frogs who require medical marijuana use a method of ingestion other than smoking.

Frogs who are medically required to smoke medical marijuana shall not engage in smoking inside any of the buildings or vehicles. Treefrog will determine an appropriate smoking area for the frog, with the goal of maintaining the confidentiality of the frog’s medical situation.

Frogs are not permitted to engage in distribution, sharing or sale of marijuana on the property of Treefrog.
