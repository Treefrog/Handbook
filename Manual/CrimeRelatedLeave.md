# Crime Related Death and Disappearance Leave

> The Rule of Thumb

<i>If your child disappears, you don't need to be here - you need to be looking for them.</i>

This is another unpaid, job protected leave under the ESA. Frogs are entitled up to fifty-two (52) weeks of unpaid job protected leave in the case of the disappearance of their child due to probable crime. Frogs are entitled up to one-hundred and four (104) weeks of unpaid job protected leave in the case of their childâ€™s death due to probable crime, commencing the week the child dies. In order to be entitled to the leave, the employee must have worked for a minimum of six consecutive months.
