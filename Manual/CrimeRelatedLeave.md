# Crime Related Death and Disappearance Leave

> The Rule of Thumb

*If your child disappears, you don't need to be here - you need to be looking for them.*

This is another unpaid, job protected leave under the ESA. Frogs are entitled up to fifty-two (52) weeks of unpaid job protected leave in the case of the disappearance of their child due to probable crime. Frogs are entitled up to one-hundred and four (104) weeks of unpaid job protected leave in the case of their child’s death due to probable crime, commencing the week the child dies. In order to be entitled to the leave, the employee must have worked for a minimum of six consecutive months.

If this is you, come and see the CEO. We will give you all the support you need.
