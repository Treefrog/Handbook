# Communal Kitchen Supplies

> Treefrog is not a grocery store.

*If you would expect to see it in 99% of other professional offices, we'll provide it too.*

While Treefrog provides some snacks and additional items (like peanut butter, or crackers), our current business model does not contain the profit margin for feeding people. Please do not expect all of your food requests to be made at this time.

> We provide normal Ketchup.

Where we do provide additional alternatives, these would be provided for the majority, not the minority (for obvious cost management reasons). For example, we would provide communal Ketchup, but not Vegan Ketchup, Kosher Ketchup, Blue Ketchup, Hot Ketchup, etc. If you have specific physiological intolerances, religious requirements or other preferences that are not consistent with the majority of Frogs, please purchase these condiments on your own. This is not because we don't love you, but because managing Ketchup preferences is too complex and expensive for our small team.
