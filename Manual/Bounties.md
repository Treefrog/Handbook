# Bounties & Special Projects

> If you need extra cash, Treefrog will try and help you.

*Everyone needs a little cash now and then. Ideally, we have enough extra revenue to afford to have you do out-of-phase projects that benefit Treefrog using your skills, instead of your getting a second job to stay alive.* 

Treefrog allows for after-hours work to be done by Frogs in order to collect rewards. These bounties are subject to change.

###Current Bounties Available

1. [**Smart Serve**](http://www.smartserve.ca) - Smart Serve certification is open to everyone.
2. [**Google Certification**](https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3154326?hl=en) - 

Bounties are only paid out if you do these on your own time or if your role at Treefrog does not require that the goals of these bounties need to be completed. 

### Special Projects

You can work on additional projects after hours under certain circumstances.
