# Bounties & Special Projects

> If you need extra cash, Treefrog will try and help you.

*Everyone needs a little cash now and then. Ideally, we have enough extra revenue to afford to have you do out-of-phase projects that benefit Treefrog using your skills, instead of your getting a second job to stay alive.*

Treefrog allows for after-hours work to be done by Frogs in order to collect rewards. These bounties are subject to change.

## Current Bounties Available

1. [Smart Serve](http://www.smartserve.ca) - Smart Serve certification is open to everyone.
2. Google Certification
3. CPR Certification
4. [Employee Referral Incentive Plan](EmployeeReferral.md)

Bounties are only paid out if you do these on your own time or if your role at Treefrog does not require that the goals of these bounties need to be completed.

### Google Certification

Here’s our company profile on Google Partners: <https://www.google.com/partners/#a_profile;idtf=7649262800>

Any one of their certifications passed will turn up on our profile. Let’s get those numbers up! Any one person passing 2 of these exams means that person will be Adwords "Certified".

Here is the link for where to take the certification exams: <https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9702955?hl=en>

When you pass an advanced course on Google, it shows up in our list of "certifications". Ergo, there is value in us passing multiple courses, and keeping them current. So I officially offer anyone who wants to pass these courses (the first "fundamentals", PLUS any other course) and/or Google analytics:

- Search Advertising
- Display Advertising
- Video Advertising
- Shopping Advertising
- Mobile Advertising
- Digital Sales

The bounty is $100 PER course, for a total of $600 in bounties per team member for passing.

You can try and pass, and not tell anyone. If you fail a course, you have to wait a week. It takes ~1-2 hours to write the tests, and ~2-3 hours to study for them.

## Special Projects

You can work on additional projects after hours under certain circumstances.
