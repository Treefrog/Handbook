# Devices

Treefrog will make a concerted effort to ensure you always have quality, working products and devices to do your job properly. It is your responsibility to treat all of Treefrog's devices with [respect](respect.md) and care.

#### Replacing Devices

If your behaviour or lack of respect for a device leads to the destruction of a device, tool, or piece of office equipment, you should replace the device at your own cost or you will be reviewed for termination. Some examples may include:

1. Using your device for non-Treefrog related activities (e.g. gaming, video rendering).
2. Sitting on your laptop in a car.
3. Using your device in the rain.
4. Knocking over a coffee onto your laptop at home.
5. Letting your dog pee on your laptop.
6. Plugging in devices into a wall without AVR protection.

*Yes, these are all things that have destroyed Treefrog equipment.

However, should you have the dumb luck to destroy or damage a device unintentionally, Treefrog will replace it **once**. If you have a second mishap, a review of your respect of devices will be engaged.

#### Using Your Own Device

When using your own personal Smartphone, iPad, or Laptop for Treefrog purposes, it is important to note that Treefrog has the right to view data on the device and that anything saved on the device should not be viewed as private. If your personal device is lost, damaged, or stolen, Treefrog is not responsible for replacing the device.

If you are using your own device for Treefrog activities, please let the [quartermaster](manual/quartermaster-know.md) immediately. In most cases, it is appropriate that you will be provided with a Treefrog device that is covered by warranty and insurance.

#### Laptop Security

For those Frogs that have portable computers, we need to ensure you are operating with extreme measures to maintain safety and protection both at the office and off-site locations. If one of our computers came into the wrong hands, it could be severely detrimental to thousands of clients. All machines will have installed a software called “Undercover” that will allow us to track our computers and the computer's location very quickly so that we can notify the police as soon as possible. This knowledge regarding this software and information is to be kept extremely confidential as a closely-held Frog secret, despite being open-sourced here on this page.

Yes, this is creepy. Yes we have limitations around who has access (CEO and Quartermaster). Yes, it's a good thing.

If you choose to cover your laptop camera with a sticker or prevent your laptop camera from operating, you are now wholly responsible for your laptop cost upon its theft. Instead, consider a tin hat.

*For those Frogs that have portable computers, we need to ensure you are operating with extreme measures to maintain safety and protection both at the office and off-site locations. If one of our computers came into the wrong hands, it could be severely detrimental to thousands of clients.*

All machines will have a software called “Undercover” installed. The software allows us to track our computers and their whereabouts very quickly so that we can notify the police as soon as possible. This knowledge regarding this software and information is to be kept extremely confidential as a closely-held Frog secret.

It is important to know that Treefrog has granted "Undercover" access to your laptop at any time, no matter where you are. In order to make sure this does not represent a violation of your privacy, only two people have access to this, the IT Person, currently Eric, and the CEO, currently Sean, who will only do so *for testing* with explicit warning and with your explicit permission.


### Software Lisencing

We do not use software at Treefrog or put it on our laptops unless it has been paid for. Not only is it unethical and counterintuitive to Treefrog's values, but also, if we are caught doing this, it could hurt our team through litigation or problems.

1. Do not install software you do not use.
2. Do not install software without express consent from the [quartermaster](manual/quartermaster.md). We don't need the problems these bring.
3. If you need something, ask for it. If it makes sense to buy it, we will.

Also, if you need something, although it looks simple to get, we do need to think about it. Therefore, expect it to take a reasonable amount of time to get the purchase completed for you.
