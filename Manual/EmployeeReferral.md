# Employee Referral Incentive Plan

> We'll thank you for helping us find great people.

In an effort to boost high quality recruitment within various departments in the Company, Treefrog is excited to implement the employee referral incentive plan. Frogs are friends, and often the best people to work towards our common goal are friends.

While Treefrog has always informally encouraged Frogs to recommend talent they think would be excellent members of the team, the Company is now formally providing a cash incentive to go out there and recruit for us!

Roles the Company is actively hiring for will be updated on an on-going basis and posted on the Treefrog website. It is important to note, a shift in our hiring policy, that many of the roles no longer require commuting to Newmarket. As a result, we are actively hiring for many roles anywhere in the Greater Toronto Area!

## Incentive

Any current Frog that puts forward a candidate for interview, who is subsequently hired will be awarded a cash bonus of $1,000 (less statutory payroll deductions).

- $500 on start date of successful hiring of a referral
- $500 on the 3-month anniversary of the start date

> Note: To participate in the Treefrog Employee Referral Incentive Plan, the Frog must be an active employee of Treefrog at the time the vested incentive is earned.

To determine eligibility in the plan, please contact Aamer.

- Plan active: April 26, 2021
- Plan renewal: April 26, 2022
