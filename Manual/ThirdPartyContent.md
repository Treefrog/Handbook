# Third Party Content

> It is illegal to steal other people's work.

It is our policy, for insurance reasons (among many), not to use third party content without explicit consent or purchasing rights to use said content.

Any content received from clients must have a signed agreement indicating that the client owns all material being posted to its site.

Content we create is not to be plagiarized or taken from other sites.

Any content provided by clients on their own site is subject to the disclaimer - "You control your own content. Therefore, you own all liability associated with the content being on your website."

Any content under dispute is to be immediately removed from the offending site unless we are explicitly told by the client to leave on the site. In this case, the client assumes all liability for the content's existence. We assume no liability before or after the content is removed.

We take no responsibility and assume no liability for the content that is placed on the websites of our clients. This includes content we create that may or may not have been created from materials we were not aware had limitations on usage.
