# Workplace Accommodation

> Treefrog is committed to providing accommodations for frogs with disabilities.

Treefrog will provide support to any frog with a disability. A frog with a disability may make a request for accommodation to their pod leader. The frog is responsible to be an active participant in helping gather information and assess the needs for accommodation. In support of the accommodation request, Treefrog requires the frog to provide information that sets out any functional limitations and the functional abilities. Once the appropriate accommodation is identified, the frog and their pod leader will work together to create a formal individual accommodation plan, which will be monitored by both parties and reviewed as required. If an individual accommodation is denied, Treefrog will provide the frog with the reason for the denial, in an accessible format. Treefrog provides individualized workplace emergency response information to frogs who have identified that they have a disability that requires accommodations. An individualized emergency response plan will be developed in confidence with the pod leader and the frog requiring accommodations. The employee will provide consent to their pod leader to share the plan with the person designated to provide assistance to the employee during an emergency. The plan will be signed and stored in the frog’s file.
