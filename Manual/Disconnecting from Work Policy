# Disconnecting from Work Policy

> Take the time you need to dissconnect and rest 


### Overview: 

Treefrog prioritizes work/life balance and the right for all Frogs to take the break they need from work to disconnect. This Disconnecting from Work Policy (“the Policy”)  supports each Frog in disconnecting from work outside of their normal working hours, subject to reasonable exceptions.
This Policy will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with all applicable legislation, including (but not limited to) Ontario’s Employment Standards Act, 2000 (the “ESA”) and Occupational Health and Safety Act.  

The purpose of this Policy is to demonstrate Treefrog’s support to disconnect from work when appropriate to assist in achieving a healthy work-life balance, regardless of whether employees are working in the workplace, remotely or in a flexible working arrangement.

Due to the evolving nature of Treefrog’s business, Treefrog may amend this Policy as it deems appropriate.  


### Disconnecting from Work:

“Disconnecting from work” under this Policy means not engaging in work or work-related communications, including emails, telephone calls, video calls or sending or reviewing other messages such that Frogs are free from working outside of their normal working hours in accordance with the ESA and this Policy, including the exceptions detailed below.


### Working Hours:

While Frogs working hours will vary within the Company, each Frogs hours of work are defined by past practice, their employment agreement and/or by agreement with their manager.   
If you have any questions regarding your normal hours of work, please consult with your manager.
It is generally expected that all employees are able to complete their work, including reviewing and responding to any work-related communications, during their normal hours of work. The Company has no expectation that employees engage in work or work-related communications outside of their normal hours of work, subject to the exceptions detailed below.  

If you are regularly unable to complete your work or attend to work-related communications within your normal hours of work, please notify your manager.

### Exceptions:

There are situations when it is necessary for Frogs to perform work or communicate with colleagues outside of their normal hours of work, including, but not limited to the following:

-Where an emergency or exigent circumstances arise, with or without notice
-To assist or fill in at short notice for a colleague
-Where the nature of the Frog’s duties requires work and/or work-related communications outside of their normal hours of work
-Unforeseeable business or operational reasons
-An employee’s request or agreement to work certain hours or have flexible working hours; and
-Other unusual circumstances as your manager may advise or which are inherent to your position.

### Work Related Communications:

Frogs should make all reasonable efforts to book meetings and calls during the core hours of work, subject to the exceptions detailed above. Some Frogs’ hours of work may differ within Treefrog. As a result, certain employees may attend to work-related communications outside of other employees’ normal hours of work. Where this is the case, the sender should consider the timing of their communications and understand that the recipient will not be expected to respond until their return to work at the earliest, unless the situation is an exception as noted above. The sender should also consider all appropriate safeguards on other employees’ normal hours of work, including but not limited to the following:

Including a line in their e-mail signature as follows: “I am sending you this email now because it is convenient for me. I do not expect you to respond to it outside of your normal hours of work.”
or
Using “Urgent” at the beginning on an email subject if the situation is outside of core work hours and considered an exception as noted above 

### Questions and Concerns 

Frogs should consult with their manager if they have any questions or concerns about this Policy.
If any question or concern regarding this Policy cannot be resolved with a manager, the matter should be raised with the Manager, Talent and Culture.
