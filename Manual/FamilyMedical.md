### Family Medical Leave

> If someone in your immediate family is at risk of dying, you should go be with them.

Family medical leave is a job protected leave under the ESA that applies to all frogs regardless of how long they have worked here. It can be taken to provide care and support to certain family members for whom a qualified health practitioner has issued a certificate stating that this family member has a serious illness with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks. Family medical leave is **unpaid, job-protected leave** of up to 8 weeks in a 26 week period. The 8 weeks do not have to be taken consecutively but must be taken in at least one week blocks of time. The Frog is responsible to inform the CEO that he or she is requesting a family medical leave of absence in advance of the commencement of the leave or as soon as possible. The Frog is responsible for providing proof from a qualified health practitioner, and upon receiving this, Treefrog will issue a record of employment that can be taken to the employment insurance office to determine if the Frog is eligible for compassionate care benefits.

This is a default concept, but we want to be considerate of one another. So sit down with your pod leader or the CEO and come to an intelligent resolution around how you can best work together.
