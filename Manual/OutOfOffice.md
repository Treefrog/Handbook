When you are going to be away from the office, the following details need to be included in your out of office message:

1. Greeting
2. How long you are away and if you will have access to your email
3. Who to contact in your absence. This must be a person
4. If the sender is a client, indicate that he or she needs to contact support (this applies to everyone in the entire company)

Here's an example:

```
Greetings,

Thank you for your email. Please note, I am away from the office with no

If your matter is urgent, please call the office during regular business
hours and speak with Andrea Gust, extension 113, or email, andrea@treefrog.ca.
