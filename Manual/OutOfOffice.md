When you are going to be away from the office, the following details need to be included in your out of office message:

1. Greeting
2. How long you are away and if you will have access to your email
3. Who to contact in your absence. This must be a person
4. If the sender is a client, indicate that he or she needs to contact support (this applies to everyone in the entire company)
5. Treefrog Signature

Here's an example:

```
Greetings,

Thank you for your email. Please note, I am away from the office with no
access to email from Monday, June 22nd until Thursday, July 2nd, 2016.

If your matter is urgent, please call the office during regular business
hours and speak with Andrea Gust, extension 113, or email, andrea@treefrog.ca.
