#### Timesheet System

> As much as possible, track your time as you go. Reconciliation time is leakage.

Frogs are responsible to track all of their working hours and time in the “FrogWeb” timesheet system. Time keeping must be accurate, maintained on a daily basis, and reconciled at the end of the week. Timesheets are critical for client billing, proposals, and payroll. The timesheet system is mandatory for all Frogs. 

All paid time must be tracked, including but not limited to, production time, management time, sales meetings, internal meetings, technical failures, phone calls, etc. Tasks that take less than 5 minutes should be tracked. Tasks that take longer than 25 minutes can be rounded up to the nearest 10 minute increment.

You are required to complete and log 40 hours per week. Anything less than 40 hours is an indicator that you have not worked a full week, and you will be required to make up those hours in the following week. Failure to make up these hours within the following week will result in disciplinary action unless this was previously arranged with management.

It is against company policy and considered time theft for a Frog to make any inaccurate recordings on his or her timesheet. Therefore, timesheets must be maintained on a daily basis. Failure to keep an ongoing timesheet is not acceptable and is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Retroactively adding to the timesheet system time in excess of 2 weeks is unreasonable as it will affect project evaluations and likely be biased or incorrect. Do not retroactively add time in excess of 2 weeks without your [Pod Champion](Pod Champion) requesting that you do so. 

*If FrogWeb shows you below 40 hours of work in a trailing quarter, there are red flags. You will not even be considered for a raise for the hour of time required to dig into your time expenditure and overall contribution to the team. Other people get the conversation first. I consider your fewer hours of negative value as equivalent to an unrealized cash bonus you have self-assigned.*

*Depending on your role, if FrogWeb shows more than 2-3 hours a week of "Admin" time over and above your 40 hours, and your role does not necessitate this by definition, there are red flags. You are possibly putting time in for work that you should not; such as, "computer failure", "lunch", "an error on a specific site [you] should have fixed", or "cleaning up after a client when [you] should have billed it under a project". Questions are raised about how you are using FrogWeb and what you are hiding. You can and should track this type of activity under Admin, and your activity should balance out to some degree with work and/or 40+ hours. If your computer is not working properly, you should be trying to do other work that is effective rather than sitting around twiddling your thumbs burning admin time.*
