# Corporate Card

> Treefrog is not a personal Interac Machine.

The corporate credit card must be used to purchase all business related expenses, where applicable.  The credit card is **not to be used to purchase personal items** and the company assumes no obligation to reimburse Frogs for expenses that are not in compliance with this policy.

It is also the responsibility of the cardholder to monitor usage of their account and report all fraudulent charges immediately to the corporate card provider.
