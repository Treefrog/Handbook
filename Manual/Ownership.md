# Ownership

> Treefrog owns your brain.

All work products produced by all salaried Frogs during salaried tenure at Treefrog is owned (and copyrighted) by Treefrog. This includes all works *that would be created by Treefrog during the course of regular work*, including but not limited to, graphic design, code, written content, and anything you do or think. We share a brain, share equipment and knowledge, and we own what comes from our efforts.

You cannot have flexible hours, mobile workspaces and privileges for working from home, forgiving attitudes, work the odd evening to catch up and then suddenly "be working on something else not relevant to the company" for work that we usually do.

We are a service company. We could get sued by our clients, and have, if it turns out you were working on something else or by mistake conflated ideas the client paid for into what you were doing.

**Example** - Tesla Motors filed a lawsuit against Fisker Automotive, alleging that Henrik Fisker stole Tesla's Model S hybrid technology and was using it to develop the Karma. Tesla's suit claimed that the design work done for the Model S sedan by Fisker Coachbuild was substandard, and that Fisker Automotive diverted its best ideas to the Karma. This cost US$1,144,285 in legal costs.

### Side Projects

You can, with explicit permission and within defined boundaries that Treefrog deems to be acceptable, work on specific projects that you own. Each project must be clearly articulated and disclosed and receive specific permission in each case.

By definition, these projects would need to be completely outside the boundaries of Conflict of Interest.
