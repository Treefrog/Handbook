# Wearing Green

> If you wear green, we may pay you $1/day.

We don't want Treefrog to have something as soul-sucking as a uniform - but we do want a soft way of showing our engagement with the Frogs. A simple way of accomplishing this is to add green to your wardrobe! There is no obligation, this is just for fun. But - we might reward you for it.

In other words, a Pod Champion or the CEO may go around the company daily and hand out "Green Bucks" at their discretion.

Every dollar is at the CEO's discretion.

### The Rules

1. You only get 1$/day - even if you change your clothes.
2. Clients might also get paid.
4. You must actually come to a Treefrog office to collect. Working from home in green pyjamas does not count.
5. The item must be an article of clothing or jewelry and must be ACTIVELY WORN and immediately recognizable as green. Purses, folders, bags, some grass you found, does not count unless it is really cool. Or, you are wearing the grass.
6. The same item may not be worn the same way on two consecutive days. As per normal conventions for workplace attire, you can only get paid once every *two weeks* for any given green article.
7. The item must be visible. It can only be your underwear if they are worn Superman style or you are willing to publicly show them.
8. Khaki is not green - it is Khaki. Treefrog green is the ideal. Do not be a green faker.

### Green Bucks

Green Bucks are dollars with a green sticker on them. As this sticker is easily removable, it does not damage the currency (that would be defacing them, which is illegal). As the Royal Canadian Mint regularly now uses Loonies for their own advertising purposes, this seems natural.
