# Return to Work after Injury or Illness

<i> Treefrog wants you to be well and will work with all frogs to ensure a safe and healthy return to work process after an injury or illness. </i>

Treefrog is committed to the prevention of workplace injuries and illnesses.  However, in the event that an injury or illness does occur at work or during off-work hours, we are deeply committed to ensuring a safe and timely return to work.  

### Frogs are responsible to do the following:

•	Report any accident, injury or illness (same day) immediately to your pod leader.

•	If you feel or think you are unable to perform your job duties as a result of your injury, you must obtain a Functional Abilities Form (FAF) from your pod leader (occupational if it was work-related; non-occupational if it was not work-related) 

•	Have your doctor complete the Functional Abilities Form (FAF) and return it immediately to your pod leader.  If the form is incomplete, the frog will be required to take it back to their doctor to complete. 	

•	Meet with your pod leader to prepare a return to work program.  This program will be developed based on the information in the Functional Abilities Form.  The length of the program will vary as well and the goal is to ensure that the frog eventually returns to regular duties.

•	Communicate any concerns about the return to work program to your pod leader in order to ensure that these problems are addressed immediately.

•	Attend all weekly evaluation sessions and ensure that any changes in your condition are reported immediately to your pod leader.

•	Maintain regular contact with your pod leader for the duration of your return to work plan.

By working together, we will be able to prepare a return to work plan that will ensure a safe and timely return to work.  For work-related injuries, it is important for all frogs to understand that if they do not take an active role in this program, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board may either reduce or suspend their benefits or deny their claim altogether.
