# Security

Like any business, Treefrog wants to protect its employees and its financial interests. During regular office hours, the doors, both front and back, should be open for staff, clients, and couriers. These doors may be open before and/or after regular hours providing there are Frogs in the office to monitor the traffic. The last Frog to leave at the end of the day is responsible for arming the building with the security code as well as locking all doors and windows. Failure to do so introduces high risk to Treefrog’s assets and confidentiality, and, as such, the Frog is subject to disciplinary action or termination. Security system codes are confidential and should not be given out to anyone under any circumstances. Sharing your security system code outside of Treefrog may result in disciplinary action or termination.

For customer service and security reasons, the office policy requires two Frogs present in the office at all times during the core business hours of 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. There must be one Frog from the design team and one Frog from the technical team. Please ensure you schedule your meals and breaks accordingly.

### Working Alone

In the event that you are working alone, you must ensure you have communicated and received prior approval from the CEO or the Controller. If it is after regular business hours, you must have the doors locked and send a message to the Controller or CEO prior to leaving at the end of the night.

Under no circumstances are you to have a client meeting alone in the office after hours. If a client meeting is required after hours, it must be scheduled in a public setting.

It is not acceptable to bring friends or other personal guests into the office location off hours. This is a breach of company privacy and would require approval from the CEO.
