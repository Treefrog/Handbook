> Treefrog does not reimburse meals.

It is up to you to bring their lunch or purchase their lunch. If you chose, you may contribute to Pizza Fridays, and that amount will be deducted from your weekly pay.

Treefrog does not reimburse Frogs when taking out prospects for coffee, lunch or dinner. If you feel you need to use this method to sell to a client, please speak to your Pod Leader regarding further training, as this is an anachronistic selling method, and considered fraud in many industries. There is coffee and beer at Treefrog - feel free to bring them here, or split the bill and only drink water. *A client who needs to be bought lunch isn't the right client for us.*

Treefrog does not cover overnight accommodations, unless approved and paid for by a client, or approved by a Pod Leader under specific circumstances (e.g. attending an event on another continent). If you can wake up early and drive there, you should.

Every once and a while, Treefrog will happily cover the costs of a Pod lunch or company meal event, as a gesture of thanks for a Pod's hard work. Each and every time, this should be cleared with the CEO. A reasonable budget should be established before the outing.
