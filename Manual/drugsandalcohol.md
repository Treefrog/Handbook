# Drugs and Alcohol

> Feel free to drink. Do not drink and work. Do not drink and drive.

Treefrog is concerned with the safety of its Frogs under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the job because being under the influence poses serious safety and health risks to themselves and others. In addition to affecting job performance, it could also affect Treefrog's excellent and professional reputation. Therefore, it is Treefrog’s policy that the use, sale, possession, and/or being under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol during working hours is strictly prohibited. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

#### Whacky Tabacky

> Smoking weed isn't a problem. Smoking weed and working or driving is a problem.

*Seriously - imaging if a conservative client comes in and smells weed on the person who is doing their work? Your smoking weed could cost you or many other people their job.*

Treefrog reserves the right to require any frog using prescription drugs to provide a doctor's certification that the use of the drug will not impair the ability of the frog to perform his or her job properly and safely.

It is Treefrog’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, frogs are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner.  Using, possessing, buying, selling, or having illegal drugs or alcohol in one's system, during working time, on Treefrog premises, or while operating Treefrog vehicles is absolutely forbidden and will result in termination with cause or other discipline as Treefrog deems appropriate.

### Drinking and Driving

> Under no circumstances! Seriously people, do not do it.

If you have a beer while at Treefrog and you intend to drive home, we will arrange for you to be taken home by another sober Frog or an Uber. Walk, bus, train, or otherwise crawl your way home, but never drive. If you are not sure, do not question it. We will find you a way home.

You may, if absolutely necessary, to prevent you from driving, sleep off your hangover in the sleep room at Treefrog. However, you may not, under any cirsumstances, bring non-Frogs into the office during this period.

### Drugs

Seriously people? There are never, ever, to ever be illegal substances on the premises. You are never to be working while under the influence of drugs. You are never to sell or distrubute drugs.

This could end Treefrog - not just our reputation, but our business. We have zero tolerance of this.

The fact that a section on this needs to be included is crazy.

### After Hours Events - Alcohol

We do, sometimes, serve alcohol to people who do not work here.

Make sure they are always served by someone with a [**Smart Serve**](http://www.smartserve.ca) certification, and do not let them drive home.

### [**Smart Serve**](http://www.smartserve.ca) Certification

Ideally, everyone should get trained in [**Smart Serve**](http://www.smartserve.ca).
