> As a digital agency, you are a Frog 24 hours a day. Act like it.

### Social Media Policy

> Frogs will be held accountable for what they write or post on social media.

Treefrog strives to maintain a positive image in the marketplace, and has adopted this policy to ensure that all frogs are aware of their responsibility to maintain a positive image as a representative of Treefrog, and to use social media responsibility and appropriately.    We must take special care to maintain the clarity, consistency and integrity of Treefrog’s corporate image, position and posture.  Anything a frog writes in the course of acting on behalf of Treefrog on the internet or other social media, can be taken as representing Treefrog’s corporate position or posture.  Any comments and/or postings that would violate our policies of Harassment, Discrimination and Workplace Violence or any unprofessional, negative, disparaging, defamatory and/or inflammatory comments and/or posts against a fellow frog, a client or any other Treefrog partner will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination with cause. Frogs are not permitted to post any information that would be considered as proprietary and confidential information including our logo and other forms of branding.  These actions will also be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination with cause. Treefrog reserves the right to monitor all frogs’ social media sites - this is not intended to interfere with your private life, or infringe on your right to freedom of expression but rather to protect ourselves and ensure that our excellent reputation is maintained.  

### Personal Social

Tweeting:
At Treefrog, we want to inspire people with the latest tips and techniques and the coolest trends relating to technology and web design. We encourage Frogs to “tweet” and spread the passion for innovation. It is important to be aware of and comply with our harassment and discrimination policies and not post or "tweet" about a subject matter that could potentially cause harm to another individual or represent the company in an inappropriate manner.
