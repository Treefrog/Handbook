# Discipline

> Treefrog does not fire people unless we absolutely have to.

As a first principle, Treefrog does not fire people unless there is genuinely no other option.

There may be times when it becomes necessary to apply progressive discipline in situations where behavior needs to be corrected, when company policies and rules have not been adhered to, or when the performance improvement process fails to meet its objectives. Treefrog uses discipline as a means to encourage Frogs to adhere to rules and regulations when all other attempts to do so have been exhausted.

Treefrog believes that a fair and just disciplinary process is based on three foundations:

1. **Rules and Regulations -** Discuss issues such as theft, destruction of property, taking drugs on the job, insubordination, etc. The purpose is to inform Frogs as to what is and what is not acceptable. This is usually done during orientation.
2. **System of Progressive Penalties -** Penalties may range from verbal warnings, to suspension from the job, to termination. The severity of the penalty is usually a function of the type of occurrence and the number of times the offence has occurred.
3. **Open Door Process -** Helps to ensure that discipline is carried out fairly and equitably. Treefrog will not dismiss Frogs at will. A Frog's employment is only terminated as a last resort.

The following outlines our progressive discipline procedures:

1. **1st occurrence: *Verbal Counseling*.** - Details of the verbal counselling may be documented and kept in the Frog's personnel file or kept in follow-up emails by the counsellor.
2. **2nd occurrence: *Written Warning*.** - A written account of the performance that needs improvement, or the behavior that needs correcting, and the Frog’s personal plan of action to improve.
3. **3rd occurrence: *Suspension*.** 1 to 3 unpaid days depending on the individual situation. This time should be used by the Frog to consider whether he or she chooses to improve his or her performance and/or correct his or her behavior. Upon completion of the suspension, the Frog will return to work and review his or her plan of action with the CEO.
4. **4th occurrence: *Termination of Employment*.**.

These are guidelines, and some instances may demand the elimination of one or more steps.
