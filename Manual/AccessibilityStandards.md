# Accessibility in Employment Standards

> The Rule of Thumb

<i>We are committed to excellence in serving all people with disabilities throughout the employment life cycle.</i>

### STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT:

This Accessibility in Employment Standards Policy outlines Treefrogâ€™s strategy to prevent and remove barriers to persons with disabilities and in order to meet the Employment Standard requirements of the AODA. Treefrog is committed to treating all persons with disabilities in a way that allows them to maintain their dignity and independence. We believe in integration and equal opportunity and are committed to meeting the needs of people with disabilities in a timely manner during the recruitment and selection process, and throughout the employment life cycle. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least once every year but may be reviewed more frequently depending on needs and legislative changes.  The policy will be communicated to each frog and will be provided in an accessible format, upon request. 

### The Employment Standard 

The Employment Standard focuses on accessibility during the employment process and post-employment process. It discusses available accommodations during the recruitment process, as well as accommodations provided to employees throughout their employment with Treefrog.   This policy applies to all paid employees of Treefrog but does not apply to other non-paid individuals who are part of the organization. 

Accommodations provided during the employment and post-employment stages including recruitment and selection, performance management, career development and advancement, job transfer and the return to work process.  During each stage, we will remain committed to providing accommodations for frogs with a disability to help them succeed in their position. This includes but is not limited to developing individualized accommodation plans, documenting workplace emergency repsonse information, preparing return to work plans, as well as arranging for the most appropriate accessible formats and communication supports to provide for job-related information that is generally available to other frogs to allow them to perform successfully in their position.
