# Terms

Upon hiring, you will be asked to sign an offer of employment that cites certain terms and conditions regarding your employment. The purpose of this agreement is to clearly establish the terms of your compensation package, hours of work, etc.

### Getting to know us

All new Frogs will participate in an orientation session prior to their official start date. At this time, the handbook and company's policies and procedures will be explained and any necessary paperwork will be completed. We will discuss company values and goals, and we will review your job description and work standards.

### Probationary Period

It is the policy at Treefrog to ensure that Frogs have the opportunity to demonstrate that they have the skills, knowledge, and abilities to do the job that they have been hired to do and to allow adequate time to make an initial assessment. The main objective of the probationary period is to coach and develop. The duration of the probationary period is 3 months, and during this time, Frogs will receive full salary but will not be entitled to participate in any of the applicable benefit programs. All Frogs will have a performance review at the end of their probationary period. If Frogs are found to be unsuitable for the job, do not perform satisfactorily, or are unwilling or unable to properly carry out their duties, they may be terminated, without notice, at any time during the probationary period or subsequent to a review of performance during the probationary period.
