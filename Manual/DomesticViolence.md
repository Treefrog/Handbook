# Domestic Violence

> The Rule of Thumb

*If you are hurting or being hurt at home, talk to us. We can help.*

 
If a pod leader becomes aware or ought reasonably to be aware, that domestic violence that would likely expose a Frog to physical injury may occur in the workplace, Treefrog Inc. shall take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of the Frog.

An Frog is responsible to report a domestic violence situation to their pod leader or a pod leader they feel most comfortable with in order for the pod leader to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of the worker.  The Frog is also responsible to disclose to Treefrog if they have a “peace” bond in place.

The pod leader and the CEO will make a decision to contact legal council or outside assistance to determine what steps will need be taken to protect the workplace and workers.

The pod leader is responsible to put together a “safety plan” to minimize the domestic violence situation from entering into the workplace.
