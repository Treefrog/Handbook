# Job Abandonment

> If you don't show up and don't call, we don't know if you are alive or stranded on a desert island.


If you have been absent from work for three (3) or more consecutive days and you have not had a single communication to your Pod leader or anyone else, we will assume you have escaped to a desert island never to return.  In this case, we will assume you have decided to abandon us for island life and essentially have voluntarily resigned.  

If, however, you were actually held captive on the island or there were other extenuating circumstances related to your failure to report to work or contact your Pod leader, then you are expected to contact them as soon as you are free again.
