# Dress

> Preferably, wear clothes.

Try to use common sense. If someone gets insulted, we are going to have to have a big long section here.

### Philosophy

Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. The way you dress will affect other people's opinions of you, both other Frogs and clients alike.

Consider: at any point, the client of our dreams could come through the door. Are you wearing old Yoga pants, or a wrinkled Hawaiian shirt? What does that say about the professionalism and inevitable success for the client?

It's amazing how having an [attitude](Attitude.md) of "dressing for success" can change your stars.

### Don't be Distracting

If anything you are wearing distracts someone else from doing their work effectively, either by being obviously titillating or otherwise offensive, you've chosen your clothes poorly.

#### Examples

* We once had someone repeatedly wear low-cut tops, to the point where everyone was complaining about the obvious sexual distraction. Not helpful.
* We once had a Fortune 500 CEO show up (in a suit and tie) for an impromptu meeting during which everyone at Treefrog was wearing the loose equivalent of wrinkled pyjamas. We didn't get the job, though we were certainly qualified to do it.

### Wear Green

We want to incentivize you for wearing green clothes. Check [Green Wearing](GreenWearing.md) for more info.
