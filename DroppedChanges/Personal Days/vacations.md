# Vacations

> Everyone gets 2 weeks of vacation, and should take it.
> 
> Think about the Frogs before you book. Don't be selfish.

*Treefrog will genuinely go above and beyond to accomodate your vacation so that you life will be balanced. However, you must also consider the impact of your vacation on the Frogs and overall productivity. Consideration for both you and Treefrog must be in balance!*

### Amount of Vacation

Every Frog has the same amount of vacation: 2 weeks (or 10 working days).

You may use **Accumulated Personal Days** (not sick days) to extend your holidays at your convenience.

### How Vacation Works

Vacations will be allotted on a **first-come, first-served** basis, subject to Treefrog’s approval. All vacation requests must be submitted via the vacation system at least **2 weeks prior** to the start of the vacation time, to ensure the company can make up for your absence. Treefrog has the sole discretion to approve or decline the requested vacation dates, based on the impact to company deliverables. *But we will do everything reasonable to accomodate you, providing it doesn't hurt others or damage Treefrog.

By law, Frogs must take a minimum of **5 consecutive days** vacation in any calendar year. The remainder of the allotted vacation days may be taken in subsequent requests consisting of (but not limited to) shorter periods.

Frogs should also NOT take more than 5 consecutive days if possible, to minimize the exhaustion of other team members supporting their absence. Vacations over 5 days should be discussed in detail with your Pod leader before approval.

If circumstances require you to cancel the already approved vacation time, Treefrog has the sole discretion to approve/decline the change in vacation dates.

If you have any time remaining in December, you must arrange with your Pod leader to take the vacations ASAP. We are legally obliged to ensure you take this vacation within the year - and it is easiest if you use your time

You are responsible to schedule your own vacations. If you feel pressured by Treefrog in any way to *not* take your vacation, please send it in writing directly to the CEO, who will help you manage it accordingly. Everybody needs a break.

### Carry Over Time

We do not carry over vacation time into future years. You *must* take your vacation in the year obligated by the ESA.

### Special Consideration: Payment in Leiu

In the rare instance where a Frog hasn't been able to take their 2 weeks of vacation within the calendar year (shame on you!), Treefrog (at the sole discretion of the CEO) may opt to offer payment in leiu of this unexpended vacation time in order to ensure the productivity of the team isn't compromised.

This request for special consideration *must* come from you, the Frog, and should not be suggested by Treefrog. You must agree that you have not been pressured to do so. Otherwise, take your vacation, for goodness' sake.

#### When will I be eligible to receive vacation pay?

Frogs will receive payment for vacations by calculating all of the "regular wages the Frog earned" and all of the "vacation pay that was payable" to the Frog in the four weeks ending just before the work week that includes the vacation. This total amount is divided by 20 to determine the amount of vacation pay the Frog will receive.

### Vacation Calendar

Vacation requests are to be logged in the vacation system (http://holidays.treefrog.ca). Everyone can see a full calendar with all Frogs' time that has been booked off tentatively (orange), and approved (green). You must go into the calendar and select the time off you are requesting. Your Champion will view your request and approve or decline your request based on staffing and company deliverables. All vacation requests must be submitted in the tracking system at least 2 weeks prior to the start of your request.

### Special vacations: Education Days

These no longer exist at Treefrog, they were replaced by [Personal Days] ().

### Champion Pod Members

As [pod-champions](manual/pod-champions.md) are members of two pods (their own, and the Champion Pod), their time must be cognizant of the scheduling of both Pods. Ergo - Pod Champions set their own vacations, but are expected to make sure their own pod bases are covered in case of sickness/etc. and additionally be available for all Champion activities.
