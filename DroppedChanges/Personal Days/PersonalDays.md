# Personal Days

> Take Personal Days if absolutely needed. You should have a buffer of available days (not holidays) to stay personally successful, where your brain stays partially available to Treefrog.

*In order to balance the success of your personal life with the success of Treefrog, we believe you should be able to take time off when necessary to do personal real-life activities.*

### What is a Personal Day?

A Personal Day is an accumulated day for you to use for anything. You can use it to be sick, get some plastic surgery, go to a friend's funeral, work at a soup kitchen, take a holiday, read a book, or pluck your nose hair - all from the comfort of your own bed, or a beach in Ouagadougou. Hang out with your friends, kids, or pet - or go shopping for that hat you've always wanted. It's your day - do what you need to do to stay healthy and happy and balanced.

However, unlike a [**vacation**] () or a [**holiday**] () (to which you are entitled), during a Personal Day there is a soft expectation that you keep an eye on Treefrog (if at all reasonably possible), to make sure the company doesn't burn to the ground while you are not physically working.

Personal Days *can* be used to extend holiday days... but you should always leave a buffer of a few Personal Days in reserve in case an emergency crops up. Don't treat future accruals with entitlement (i.e. have zero accumulated Personal Days and then book a vacation 6 months in advance expecting to use 6 Personal Days in your vacation). Anything could happen! These days are designed as an insurance policy for month-tomonth real life issues and to help you balance your life - not as a replacement for vacation days. You have [time set aside]() for that.

### How do I Accumulate Personal Days?

Every month you work at Treefrog, you accumulate an additional half-day (in your first year) or one day (in all subsequent years) of either **Sick Days** or **Accumulated Personal Days**. This is effective on the first day of the month, every month. If you have accumulated three (3) sick days, you then begin to accumulate Personal Days.

| Years at Treefrog    | Accumulated Days | Time to Accumulate 3 Sick Days |
|----------------------|:----------------:|:------------------------------:|
| First Year           | .5               | 6 Months                       |
| 2-1000 Years         | 1                | 3 Months                       |

Your first 6 months of continuous service at the company earns you your first 3 days. The first three accumulated days are your [**sick days**] () - only for use when sick, requiring a note from your doctor. If you do not get sick during this time, and continue to work an additional two months (2 x .5 = 1 day), you have earned a full Personal Day to use at your leisure - not just if you are sick.

Should you not get sick or take off Personal Days, you may accumulate up to a maximum of your **Potential Personal Days**. This number of days increases as your tenure at Treefrog increases.

You can **only use these first 3 accumulated days for sickness**, not personal use. If at any point you get sick - your day off sick counts first against any Personal Days you have outstanding. Once all of your Accumulated Personal Days have been expended due to sickness, your sick days are expended.

### How Many Personal Days Do I Get?

Every additional year as a Frog, you have the potential to earn an additional maximum Personal Days, up to a maximum of 10 Personal Days.

Your total ***Potential Personal Days*** grows by one (every year, on the first of the month AFTER your Frogaversarie).

Once your **Maximum Potential Personal Days** has been accumulated, your Personal Days no longer accumulate. Don't feel obligated to take them: this is not an entitlement, but a privilege. Keep them topped up for future emergencies or use.

### I've Accumulated Them. Now How do I Take Them?

You shouldn't just take them whenever you want (unless it's an emergency, obviously). Be reasonable with your Pod leader, and work to minimize the damage to the team and the company.

Three letters: ask.

### Who Counts Them?

Tina will count 3 numbers on your Pay Stub:

- Accumulated Sick Days (up to a maximum of 3, accumulated first)
- Accumulated Personal Days (your total accumulated days, after 3)
- Potential Personal Days (anywhere between 3 and 10, depending on your tenure)

**Example 1:** (A Frog who has been around for three years and has been sick at least one day)

`Sick Days 2/3
Personal Days 0/5 `

**Example 2:** (A Frog who has been around for 12 months and hasn't been sick or taken a Personal Day)

`Sick Days 3/3
Personal Days 3/3 `

Check your pay stub regularly to ensure that the numbers are correct. It is your duty to our mutual success for you to be rational and challenge both missing and additive mistakes.

### Half Personal Days

Don't do this, please. If you work less than an hour, it's considered a full Personal Day. Be reasonable accordingly.

### Do Personal Days Roll Over at the End of the Year?

This question doesn't make any sense. Personal Days accumulate with months worked - ergo, the have nothing to do with calendar years at all.

### What's the Difference Between a Sick Day and a Personal Day?

You can't use your sick days for personal needs. You must have a Doctor's Note to use your sick days - these days are reserved for genuine sickness. They exist as an insurance policy - an "absence overdraft" into which you can dip when sick.

### What's the Difference Between a Vacation Day and a Personal Day?

A Vacation Day is meant for you to get away and not think about Treefrog (as much as possible).

During your "Personal Days", it is expected that you maintain reaaonable contact with Treefrog (by Slack/email/phone) to ensure that you can continue to help keep the company rolling.

We do not collect for or manage your salary relating to Personal Days. Ergo, if you quit, you are not paid out on these days, either.

### What Happens my First Year?

After two months, you have the ability to take a "sick day". (Obviously, you can take emergency sick days in your first three months, but you don't get paid for them. This isn't a Gulag).

### Other Points

You should NOT take more than 5 consecutive days off if possible, to minimize the exhaustion of other team members supporting their absence. Vacations over 5 days should be discussed in detail with your Pod leader before approval.

### Buying out Your Personal Days

It's a thought. Talk to the CEO.
